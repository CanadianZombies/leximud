	Description:$
`R1`n - Multiplaying is not permitted by 101/102 Staff. This means:
    `BA`y)`n multiplaying in the mortal/mortal sense
    `BB`y)`n multiplaying your staff character/mortal(s)
    `BEXCEPTION`y)`n approved play-testing with an authorized test mortal
 
`R2`n - Giving away any of the following without permission is prohibited:
    `BA`y)`n equipment, esp. in regards to, but not limited to: weapons & armor
    `BB`y)`n mission point cookies/presents/etc.
    `BC`y)`n mission points via "reward" or a script
    `BD`y)`n Staff specific information from the security terminal, stats on 
       mobs/objects, IP numbers, alt names (especially of staff)

`R3`n - Purchasing/loading of MEQ by 101 staff is `Rprohibited`n.
  
`R4`n - Do not create equipment, be it weapons or armor, to be placed on mobs
    for mobile or player use without permission to do so, and instruction
    on steps to be taken to prevent misuse.
 
`R5`n - If creating mobs based on existing immortals/mortals, be sure NOT to
    put his/her name on the namelist as an alias.  This prevents the need
    to place a '.' before the name when transing the player.

`R6`n - Do not create scripts that perform any of the following functions:
    `BA`y)`n allow you access to higher-level staff commands
    `BB`y)`n allow a mortal access to staff commands
    `BC`y)`n allow for specific player activation, i.e. by only certain players,
       based on player name or a code that only certain players will know
    `BD`y)`n allow you to bypass system logs
 
`R7`n - Do not show partisanship. Treat all staff/players with equal respect.
 
`R8`n - Do not meddle in security matters unless there is a great need to do so,
    and then only if you have been instructed on the proper measures to be
    taken for specified rule violation(s).  Additionally under this section,
    be sure to write a message on the security terminal stating player
    name, IP, and the nature of the violation.
 
`R9`n - Do not kill players, period.  Trans them from a mission.
 
`R10`n - Do not create "personal" objects for your staff character.
 
`R11`n - Do not adjust player stats or level, and/or reimburse them for
     supposedly "lost" MEQ.  Stay out of the entire aspect of assisting
     players with issues that senior staff and administrators would
     normally take care of.

`R12`n - Staff members do not complain or ask questions about gameplay over ANY
     public forum - be it CHAT or a terminal.  Staff members, while on their
     moratals, will not contribute in a negative way to any conversation
     about any aspect of the game.  If a Staff member has a problem with an
     aspect of the game, or a recent decision, it should be voiced on his
     staff character, and over wiznet or mudmail.  Staff members must know
     that they are staffers while on their mortal, and players will see them
     as such.  They thus represent the Staff while on their mortal.  Staff
     should act accordingly.  Failing to do this makes the staff look as 
     though it is incompetent among what it is doing as a whole, aside from
     conveying irresponsibility, inconsistency, and unprofessionalism.

`G--------------------------------------------------------------------------`n
This guide is subject to change at any time, and only covers the basics
of immortal policy.  All mortal policies also apply to immortals, and are
available by use of the "policy" command.  You are also required to
read the IMOTD carefully and understand everything contained therein,
and keep up with the posts of the security terminal, and e-mails sent
sent out on avp-staff.

`GLevel 104`n - Administration

Administrators are not only the eyes and ears of the owner, but are also
the owner's voice.  They can speak on behalf of the owner, and are also
responsible for seeing that his requests are delegated to the staff itself.

Administrators usually head up the Game Design and Game Balance
departments.  They approve any gameplay changes, such as the addition of new
skills, special equipment, or the rebalancing of game play features.
Features that do not directly effect gameplay, such as missions, new clans
and zones, do not require approval from the administration.

The Administration obviously has a say in any aspect of the game,
regardless of its need for approval.  Administrators are capable of
implementing any new game feature autonomously, while still taking the 
proper procedures of updating help changes, the motd, TWiki, help files, etc.

A Head Administrator is usually appointed to have a much larger role among
the staff and their workings, while also keeping an eye on the system logs.
The Head Admin works closely with the owner in updating him on the progress
of new projects and the condition of the MUD, and the Staff.

`GLevel 103`n - Senior Staff

The Senior Staff are usually appointed to be the Heads of specific 
departments such as Missions, Clans, and Terraforming.  Some staffers may
be promoted on the basis of good work, maturity, professionalism, productive
activity, and helpful insight into gameplay issues.

Senior Staff coordinate the efforts of the staffers working in their 
respective departments.  They function pretty independetly of the 
administration in that they can work without its direct supervision.  The
Senior Staff is entrusted with the care of each department.  Senior Staff
are capable of implementing new additions to the MUD that do not require
Administrative approval, such as new zones, missions, and clans.  Senior
Staff must go about the appropriate steps in updating help changes, the motd,
TWiki, and any other help files when adding new features to the MUD.

Senior Staff who are the Heads of departments must also hire interns to
work in their departments.  They must advertise for applications, review 
them, and either request permission for hiring from an Administrator, or
send the player a notice saying that his or her application was denied.
Refer to the TWiki file for more info.  They must also go about firing
interns who fail to meet the expectations set forth during the two week
evaluation period.  When firing Staff members, Senior Staff must seek
Administrative approval.

All Senior Staff are expected to use their OLCADMIN wisely, specifically
in terms of correcting typos, helping clan leaders when the Head of Clans
is not available to address a very simple issue with a clan base, correcting
zone errors, and resetting shops.  Senior Staff should never interfere with
classes, their MEQ, or skills, but should notify the respective
Administrator as to a possible problem.

			Description:$
`GLevel 102`n - Staff

The Staff work directly under the senior staff member of his or her 
particular department.  New ideas are submitted to the senior staff member,
who would then see about the work beginning, checking on it, and then if 
necessary, seeking approval from the administration.  Staff must concern
themselves only with their department, unless summoned for work in another,
specifically Game Design.

Staff members cannot delegate new work to other Staff members.  Only the
Administration or the Senior Staff can put a staffer on a new project.  Staff
members are equals.  Staffers are expected to maintain decent levels of
productive activity.  Each staff member works with a specific task at hand
for completion, and then is delegated another. 

In the event when the real world places a demand on a staffer's MUD time, 
they must notify their Senior Staff member of how long they will be absent
and why.  Inactivity is the most common grounds for deletion.

`GLevel 101`n - Intern Staff

Interns are newly hired staff members.  They undergo a trial period of 
about two weeks, in which they are under close eye of the Senior Staff member
that hired them.  Interns are expected to log on regularly, and to go about
the completion of a specific project given to them.  

They should not have any hand in any other aspect of the game, nor should
they be exploring other areas.  Interns will not load any unneeded items, as
a full set of WYMEQ is not only useless, but it demonstrates from day one
the desires of an intern.

It is very important for interns to report directly to their Senior Staff
member, and to not even concern themselves with the administration.  Interns
should focus completely on learning the skills necessary to be a full Staff
member.  Interns are at the bottom of the pecking order, as it is almost a
form of initiation.

Interns should ask questions and seek help from those in their department
without any hesitation, as interns are here to learn.  Interns not showing
satisfactory productivity, who have a poor attitude, or who are disrespectful
will not be hired for Staff.

`GGame Balance Protocol`n  

In many ways, the Game Balance Department is an omnious entity in that it
oversees classes, skills, and all equipment put into the game.  This requires
a close relationship with the Game Design Department and even the Clan
Department (when considering CMEQ).

The Game Balance Department looks to maximize gameplay efficiency, while
seeking parallelism among all game features, and coherency for players via
help files and object descriptions.  The most important task is the first,
gameplay efficiency, in that constant attention is paid to aspects of the 
game that have either broken down, or could be made better.

The Game Balance Department does not operate via TWiki staff discussions,
but by private in game deliberation.  It is often times much easier to get
minor things done when there is a minor amount of discussion about them. 
Specific Senior Staff and Staff members are usually consulted in these
regards, so any general staff discussion is usually lightly considered. When
it comes to major revisions of gameplay, such as the class system,
deliberation is usually reserved for the administration and its consultants.

The Game Balance Department abides by specific outlines and in-game data
resources, such as armor ratings, statistic/skill allowances, MEQ weight,
and DPS restrictions - all of which are fully documented.  Though not set in
stone, theses guidelines provide a constant for the Department, thus 
providing a universal foundation for balance.

Both the Game Balance Department and the Game Design Department work 
together in implementing new class features.  Game Design puts forth a new
feature, and Game Balance considers it usefulness and affects in gameplay.
As alluded to before, only specific Senior Staff and Staff members are 
entrusted with Game Balance work as they demonstrate a wide range of game
experience with some insight and responsibility. General members should
generally stay out of Game Balance issues.

`GThe Terraforming Department`n

The Terraformer Division manages the creation and balancing of new zones,
as well as revisions or changes to existing ones. The Terraformer's main tool
is OLC, Online Creation, a system of menus which allow the Terraformer to
manipulate mobs, objects and rooms.  While scripting experience is not 
essential, it is useful for terraforming purposes.  

Terraformer Staff may run missions, but only with permission from the Head
of Missions.  The Head Builder maintains the right to prohibit staff from
running missions if Terraformers are not terraforming themselves.

The Terraformer Division has a Head Builder, who directs the efforts of
the Staff and Interns, as well as any Senior Staff working with him.  Staff
are encouraged to give their input on the projects that they are working on
in a mature, organized, and respectful manner on TWiki.  There are always
several projects requiring work, and the Staff are free to choose the 
projects in which they wish to participate.  The Head Builder will check
regularly on each Staff member's work.

Terraformers may be called upon by other departments to work on projects
not related to the Terraforming Division.

`GThe Missions Department`n

The Mission Department is responsible for running missions on a timely
basis.  Mission Operators are responsible for creating one's own missions if
one has the ability to do so.
  
Before one begins creating a mission, one must first tell the idea to the
Head of Missions either through mudmail, in-game, or on TWiki for review.
Although creating missions is not a required part of being a Mission
Operator, it is a great way to expand the department.

Mission Operators also have the freedom to build zones with confirmation
from the Head Builder.  If a Mission Operator feels that he does not have
any work to do, he may build a zone, come up with a mission to create, or
seek odd jobs in the Game Design Department.

Mission operators may be called upon by other departments to work on projects
not related to the Mission Department.
