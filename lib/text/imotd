        IMOTD Updated, Sr. Staff start posting changes and keep things
        updated.  Staff and Interns, tell Sr. Staff when you do stuff, make
        sure to get permission first too. If its a major change, make sure to
        have MOTD updated too. But save staff and technical changes to IMOTD,
        as players aren't affected by those that much.
