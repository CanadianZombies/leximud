`B=============================================================================`n
`yBe sure you have read, and agree to comply to, `RALL`y the policies outlined`n
`ybelow. If you have any questions, please contact a staff member!`n
`yRemember, `Rignorance is no excuse`y.`n
`B=============================================================================`n

1. `yNO MULTIPLAYING`n.  You may not have more than one character logged into the
   MUD at a time.  Multiple players from a LAN is subject to approval.
   You may not use high level alts to take revenge on other players.
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Fine, confiscation of MEQ, ban, deletion.

2. `yNO BUG ABUSE`n will be tolerated.  If you find a bug, report it to a staff
   member or an administrator immediately (use mudmail if none are online).
   Type `cwizlist`n for the admin's names.
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Fine, confiscation of MEQ, ban, deletion.

3. `yNO TRIGGERS, SCRIPTS, TIMERS, OR BOTS`n are allowed, *`GEXCEPT`n* a log-in trigger.
   You may not use anything that will provide an automated response.
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Fine, confiscation of MEQ, ban, deletion.

4. `yNO SPAMMING`n of the public channels or rooms will be tolerated.
   In addition, all rules on `chelp chat`n must be abided by.
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Fine, confiscation of MEQ, ban, deletion.

5. `yNO BIGOTRY, HATE SPEECH, OR SEXUAL CONTENT`n, including racism and sexism.
   Don't expect double standards - we have zero tolerance, this includes
   'cultural' speech which might be considered racism if used by others.  We
   don't give a damn what race you are, you don't get an exception.
   `GEXCEPTION`n: The '`mBITCH`n' channel (type nobitch to enable) has no rules
   regarding content.  This channel is OFF by default.
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Mute, fine, freeze.

6. `yNO HARRASSMENT`n of ANY kind will be tolerated.  If you feel you are being
   harrassed, create a log of it to present to the staff.  If no staff are
   present, e-mail/mudmail the administration.
   NOTE: This includes repeatedly killing players, and frequent traitoring.
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Mute, fine, freeze, ban, deletion.

7. `yDO NOT SHARE YOUR PASSWORD`n with anyone.  Character sharing is NOT allowed.
   You are responsible for your character.  If you have an issue with your
   character being 'hacked' or 'stolen', contact an administrator.
   Siblings, parents, spouses, visiting friends, etc are not hackers.  We
   don't care if "your little brother did it."  If you allow your character
   to be easily accessed by others, it is STILL your responsibility.

8. `yRESPECT THE STAFF`n.  The staff of AvP are a volunteer force that work here
   for their love of building and running a MUD.
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Mute, fine, freeze, ban, deletion.

9. `yDO NOT EVADE PUNISHMENTS`n.  Evading a punishment will result in a harsher
   punishment.  This includes abusing loopholes that have not been fixed.
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Anything goes.  You've been warned.

10. `yDO NOT MISBEHAVE`n.  We expect players to be reasonably well behaved.
   Disruptive, rude, or generally annoying players are not welcome.  Pushing
   the limits of the rules is not acceptable.  Just because something is not
   explicitly forbidden by a rule, does not mean mean it is allowed.  If you
   think you might get punished for it, you probably will!
   `cRecommended Punishments`n: Anything goes.  You've been warned.

This policy is the law of AvP, and will be strictly enforced.  It may be
changed at any time, and without any notice.  It is your responsibility to
check it often.  Punishments can range from verbal warnings to full-out bans.
`cRecommended`n `cPunishments`n are only a guideline, and punishments are left to the
`Rdiscretion of the staff`n member handling the situation.  You may NOT appeal to
FearItself if you feel you have been wronged; take your case to the forums.

You are playing AvP, which is a privately owned and operated game, as a
guest.  Playing here is not a right.  We reserve the right to refuse service
to anyone at any time, for *`RANY`n* reason.

Bottom line: Obey the rules so that we can all enjoy the game together!
