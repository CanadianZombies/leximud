! ^
Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.
Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"
Examples:
  > tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
  No-one by that name here.
  > ^asmusse^asmussen
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'
  > ^ou^ou doing
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

'IMC NOTES'
Notes (boards, mail, etc) are very mud-dependent, but in general, if they
have been connected to IMC, then you can simply write notes to player@mudname
in addition to normal 'player'.

For example, you may be able to do:

note to abcde@somemud anotherplayer immortal@someothermud

and the note would go to:
  abcde on the mud called 'somemud'
  anotherplayer on your mud
  all immortals on the mud called 'someothermud'

The 'playernames' used are interpreted by the mud that receives them, not
your mud, so be careful when writing notes to group names such as 'immortal'.

If your note cannot be delivered within 12 hours for some reason (if the
mud is down, does not exist, or refused your mail) then you will get a note
from the system telling you so.

'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' RINFO
IMC Immortal commands:

- RINFO       : A channel which the various hubs put status reports onto. Can
                be spammy at times; you may want to turn off rinfo for this
                reason.
- RSOCKETS    : displays debugging info on the current IMC connection state.
- RCONNECT    : force a connection to a directly connected mud.
- RDISCONNECT : forcibly disconnect a directly connected mud.
- RIGNORE     : ignore a player or an entire mud on IMC.
- MAILQUEUE   : show the current queue of pending inter-mud notes.
- IMC         : edit the IMC configuration for your mud (see 'IMC CONFIG')
- RCHANSET    : manage access to IMC channels/rtell/rbeep for players.
- RPING       : trace IMC connectivity

'IMC CONFIG'
The 'imc' command is used to configure your IMC setup:

Syntax:  imc add <mudname>            - add a new IMC connection entry
         imc set <...>                - set the details of an IMC connection
         imc delete <mudname>         - remove an IMC connection
         imc rename <old> <new>       - rename an IMC connection
         imc reload                   - load a new IMC config file from disk
         imc localname <name>         - set the local IMC name
         imc localport <port>         - set the local IMC port

Add, delete, and rename should be self-explanatory. The name of an IMC
connection MUST match the name which the other end is using.

Reload destroys the version of the configuration in memory, and reloads it
from disk. This is useful if you have hand-edited the config file and want
to load your changes without rebooting. 'imc reload' also reloads the
rignores file.

The set command has several forms:

imc set <mudname> all <data...>     - set all values for a mud
                  host <hostname>   - set the hostname to connect to
                  port <portnum>    - set the remote IMC port to connect to
                  clientpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive client password
                  serverpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive server password
                  rcvstamp <value>  - set the receivestamp
                  noforward <value> - set the noforward bitmask
                  flags <value>     - set the connection flags

The 'all' form takes a series of values:

imc set <mudname> all <host> <port> <clientpw> <serverpw> <rcvstamp>
                      <noforward> <flags>

For information on the exact details of each field, see the IMC documentation.

The localname and localport commands set the IMC name and port of -your- mud.
Use with care.

AC ARMOR AA ABSORB
Armor rating is divided into categories by weapon type.  Each piece of armor
adds a percentage of resistance against each type of attack.  A higher 
percentage of armor equals less damage dealt to you by that type of weapon.

By typing `cattr`n, you can view your current armor rating status.

The weapon types are:  
BLN(Blunt) SLA(Slash) IMP(Impale)  BAL(Ballistic)  FIR(Fire)  ENR(Energy)

Each class has 5 sets of armor, each with different strong, weak, and 
moderate armor values. One can identify the armor of their opponent by
looking at them and finding the (TAG) next to the armor they are wearing.
It is smart to use a weapon whose damage type is either the moderate or weak
of one's opponent.

Each class has a (MOD) armor, or an armor that has moderate protection to
all damage types.  Below are the strength tags seen on all class armors.

One does not need to memorize these, just know not to use the damage type
of which your opponent is wearing a strong absorbing armor.  
`cStrong`n absorb, and `rWeak`n absorb...all other types are Moderate absorb.

`GMarine`n
`c(SLA)        `rImpale`n  
`c(BLN)        `rEnergy`n
`c(IMP/ENR)    `rBlunt`n, `rSlash`n 
`c(BLN/BAL)    `rImpale`n, `rEnergy`n

ADVANCE
Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.

Example:

  > advance rasmussen 34

See also: SET
#101
AEDIT
Usage: aedit [ save | <social> ]

AEDIT <social> is used to edit a social.
AEDIT SAVE will save the socials file.

The action strings use special $-control sequences to insert arguments
such as the characters' name, victim's name, etc.  These sequences are:

  $n - Write name, short description, or "someone", for character.
  $N - Like $n, except for victim.
  
  $m - "him", "her", or "it", of character.
  $M - Like $m, except for victim.
  
  $s - "his", "her", or "it", depending on the gender of character.
  $S - Like $s, except for victim.

  $e - "he", "she", "it", depending on the gender of character.
  $E - Like $e, except for victim.

  $p - Short description or "something" for object.

  $t - body part/extra argument.
  
  These MIGHT work, but its not sure if they will:
  $a - "an" or "a", depending on the first character of object's name.
  $$ - Print the character '$'.

Examples:
  
  > aedit lick
  > aedit hoorah
  > aedit save
  
NOTE: 'lick' and 'point' are two very good examples of enhanced socials, and use
almost all of the $-control sequences.

ALIAS ALIASES
Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

ALIENS XENOMORPHS

This new, relatively unknown parasitic species of life form, is considered
the most deadly.

The Xenomorph life-cycle begins with an egg, layed by a Queen.  From this egg
hatches the first stage, an aptly named "facehugger".  The facehugger, which
looks like a walking "hand" - with eight legs and a tail - which hunts down a
living being, and attaches itself to the face or other bodily orifices of the
prey.  It then secretes a chemical to sedate its prey, and proceeds to implant
an embryo into the new "host".  When impregnation is complete, the facehugger
falls off and dies.  Eventually the host recovers, and is able to resume normal
operation.  Over time, the host will experience hot flashes, body pains, and
other flu-like symptoms, as the parasitic alien inside it grows and develops.
When the parasite matures, it begins convulsing, attempting to claw/puncture
its way out of the host.  The process usually kills the host.  After birth,
the alien is small (depending on the size of host), and will grow to become an
adult alien, with traits similiar to its host.  The adult alien is a deadly,
efficient drone, which works on aquiring other hosts for the facehuggers of its
hive, building the hive, and protecting the queen.  On occassion, a queen alien
is born, which will grow to a larger form, and be capable of reproduction by
laying eggs.

Xenomorphs are the deadliest fighters in hand-to-hand combat, being extremely
strong and agile.  Their speed is extroirdinary, their sheer strength and
instinctive killing ability unrivaled.  They are, without doubt, the ultimate
killer.

Xenomorphs are organized in a caste structure within the hive.  There is a
single queen alien, which lays the eggs for Facehuggers.  There are several
castes of alien, including drone workers, warriors, and "royal guard" - the
best fighters, which guard the queen and the center of the hive, where all the
eggs are.  The warriors defend the hive and drones, which collect hosts and
bring them alive to the hive, and imprison them in resign near eggs which are
near ready to hatch.

Although strong, xenomorphs are generally fragile.  A single well-placed pulse
rifle shot can kill a xenomorph, although the difficulty in making such a shot
is extreme.  Xenomorphs work best when attacking in swarms, since they have no
ranged combat and must get in close.  However, in cramped close quarters with
little or no ability for ranged combat, a single alien can tear through a
group of humans.

BAN UNBAN
Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

BOARDS
Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; type '/h' for a list of
commands available when writing.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

  > idea make a restaurant on Ceres Major, it's more realistic
  > typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'in so and so room

Please be specific, especially with typos. Example: try to give the name of the 
room and the zone in which you found the typo.  

Since all of these are logged to files not accessable to all
staff, it would be easier to contact a staff member directly while they
are online, or via mudmail.

CLAN CLANS

Basic Clan Information:

As a clan member, it is your moral obligation to smash, destroy, and 
otherwise exterminate opposing clans with extreme prejudice in your own
clan's bid for universal MUD dominance.  Show no mercy, take no prisoners,
and for the love of God, don't squeeze the Charmin.

Your goals are simple: find an opposing clan's ship in space, smash
everything inside, and capture their flag at their flag room. Naturally,
opposing clans will seek to do the same, so remember the golden rule of
conflict: do unto others before they do unto you.

Clan member limit: 12
No interracial clans allowed.

See `GHELP CLANAPP`n for the clan leadership application.
See `GHELP CLANBASE`n for information regarding clan bases.
See `GHELP CMEQ`n for information regarding CMEQ.

FLAGS
`nPlayers sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

  `nFLAG        MEANING
  `n----------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  `n(TRAITOR)   Player is trying to kill his/her friends.  That means you
                can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
  `n(invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are
                sensitive to the presence of invisible things.
  `n(writing)   Player is writing on the board; do not disturb.
  `n(mailing)   Player is writing mail; do not disturb.
  `n(deaf)      Player has chosen not to hear shouts.

FLEE
`GUsage`n: `cflee`n

Use the `cflee `ncommand to escape combat, thus moving you to an adjacent room.  
`cFlee`n will not always be successful, so several attempts may be necessary to
run from combat.

FOLLOW
Usage: follow <leader>

Use FOLLOW to automatically follow someone else.

Examples:

  > follow ras
  > follow self

See also: GROUP, SNEAK

FORCE
Usage: force <victim | all> <command> <arguments>

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

Example:

  > force fido drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look fido

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.
#0
FREEZE THAW
Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

GET TAKE
`GUsage`n:`c `cget`n | `ctake `n<object>`n
`c       `cget`n | `ctake all `n[object]`n
`c       `cget`n | `ctake 5.`n<object>`n`n

If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick
it up.  'get' can also be used to extract items from containers.
"Get" and "take" are exactly the same and can be used interchangeably.

Examples:

  `K`n>`B `wget magazine corpse`n`n
`B  `K`n>`B `wget all corpse`n`n
`B  `K`n>`B `wget all 5.corpse`n`n

GOTO TRANS WIZTELEPORT
Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

GROUP

`cGrouping combines the power of players and shares mission points for killing`n
`cmobs and players equally among the group.  Mission points will only be shared`n
`camong group members that are in the same room at the time of the killing `n
`cof a mob.  Sharing occurs regardless of the group members participation in`n
`cthe fight.  A player must also be in the same zone to receive mission points`n
`cfor the killing of a player.  In neither circumstance will a player receive`n
`cmission points while in a safe room.`n

`cTo make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group`n
`c"follow" that player using the follow`n command, thus making him lead.
The leader should not follow anyone at all. The leader must include himself
in the group.

`cGroup`n with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
`cGroup <player name>`n either bands or disbands a person following you.
`cGroup all`n groups all people who are following you, including yourself.
`cUngroup`n will disband the entire group.

Note, use `cgroup <player name>`n to remove a player from the group.  Examples:

Quifael and Redferne wish to group with Dragon.

  `w>Quifael and Redferne: "follow dragon"`n
  `w>Dragon:`n `w"group redferne"`n, `w"group quifael"`n

HIDE COVER
`GUsage`n: `chide`n or `ccover`n
       
Hide is for ALIENS only.  The 'Stealth' skill increases the efficiency of
hide while also speeding the delay to actually become hidden.  When hidden,
an alien is invisible both at range and within the same room as an enemy.
Hide is removed when moving, attacking, or using most commands. A fight
timer on a hiding alien makes it much easier to detect.

Cover is for MARINES only.  The 'Stealth' skill speeds the delay to enter
into cover.  Cover prevents a marine from being seen on `cscan`n and from
being shot at range. Removed when moving, in melee combat, or when using most
commands.  Shots from a covered marine come from 'somewhere.  A combat timer
does not remove cover, but it is useless during those 3 seconds after combat
When the timer is removed, however, cover kicks back in automatically.

Predators who are TRAPPERS gain the use of hide with a dampening suit.

Sneak is no longer a command, but is given via scripts and items.

An increased 'Notice' skill is helpful to detect hidden and invis targets.

   Hidden people, even if you don't have 'sense life'
   Dark rooms, even if you don't have a light

It is expected most immortals will keep HOLYLIGHT on most of the time;
it exists so that you have the ability to see what mortals see for
debugging purposes.

HOUSE

`GUsage`n: `chouse`n [<player name>]

Typing `chouse`n with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on
your house's guest list.  Typing `chouse`n with the name of a player will add
that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, or will
remove the player from the guest list if the player is already on the list.
The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD, although
he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.

Guests of your house will be able to enter your house until you remove them
from the guest list.

`wNote, houses are in revision at this time and thus are currently not 
available to players.`n

HOUSES
A house grants a player a private recall room and a room with access 
crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed to enter the 
house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You can force
your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in it.  In the event of a
crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save will be loaded 
back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own a house, and
quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be loaded into 
your house next time you enter the game.. 

You can simply enter your house and quit and all objects will be saved  
There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be stored 
in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay `cMPs`n for the benefit
of houses.  Contact the Staff for more.

HUMANS
Humans are the most popular race among marines in the United States
Colonial Marine Corp (USCMC).  Though humans are the weakest of all the 
races, starting with only 1000 hitpoints, they are probably the best at
ranged combat, particularly in anything having to do with being a long
Shoot God sniper.

A wide range of equipment is available to Humans, as they are able to 
use all gadgets, devices, and explosives.

Most humans are affiliated with the Colonial Marine Corps (CMC) and the
Colonial Marine Airborne Regiments (CMAR), which supply most of the human
equipment.

Being the race with the least amount of constitution, humans should work in
groups to survive.  A solitary human is rarely a challenge, but a group that
coordinates its efforts can wipe out the enemy in a matter of moments.
Humans rely on coordination and skill to trounce their enemies.

ICE
ICE - the IMC Channel Extensions protocol

ICE is a response to the cesspool-like attributes that rchat, rimm, and
even rcode have acquired over the last few months. It is IRC-ish in some
ways, but hopefully it will be used more constructively than IRC.

For a quick introduction and setup guide for ICE, see ICE-INTRO

The basic ICE structure is (greatly simplified):

. Some nodes on IMC - normally hubs - run channel daemon code that
  manages channels
. Each of these nodes maintains a list of the channels they manage, and
  the various attributes of them - who owns them, and so on
. The daemons regularly tell all muds on IMC what channels they have, and
  what their attributes are
. Based on this information, the muds on IMC decide which of their local
  users can use which ICE channels. If one mud is modified to ignore these
  restrictions, then the other muds will recognize this (since they, too,
  know the restrictions) and ignore messages from that mud.

Every channel on ICE is of the form nodename:channelname, for example a
channel called hub2:IAdmin is the channel IAdmin maintained by the node hub2.
Each mud picks which channels it is interested in (see ILIST and
ISETUP) and creates a local channel name which can be used to talk on
that channel.

Generally, any admin on a mud can create a channel on any node - although
nodes can be configured to restrict who can create channels. Whoever
creates a channel owns it, and can control who can use that channel (in
whatever way they wish). The trick, of course, is to persuade the admins
of other muds that your channel has value. Creating and modifying a
channel is done via the ICOMMAND command.

Channels can be tuned into and out of on a player-by-player basis by
using the ICHAN command.

There are a variety of ways of controlling who can hear and use a channel
- see ICE-POLICY for more information.

ICE-INTRO
A Quick Introduction to ICE

This assumes that the code for IMC and ICE is installed and running, and
that you have an active connection to an IMC network.

1. ILIST. This will give you a list of possible channels to choose from.
   Pick one that you want to add, that has a policy of 'open'. Note its
   name (of the form node:channel).

2. Decide what command you want to use to speak on this channel on your
   mud. This is the channel's localname.

3. Type: ISETUP ADD <node:channel> <localname>

4. You should now be able to use the channel. Others can listen to and
   speak on the channel by using ICHAN <localname>.

5. You may wish to reconfigure the default local channel settings.
   ILIST <localname> will display them; ISETUP will change them.

6. Repeat for whatever other channels you wish to have.

ICE-POLICY
ICE Channel Policies

Channels can have one of three policies - open, closed, and private. They
also have one owner, and zero or more operators (assigned by the owner).
They also have an include and exclude list (which can specify both
individual players ['user@mud'] and entire muds ['mud']), which can be
modified by the owner and the operators.

- Open. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel). People on the exclude list cannot use the channel,
  with the exception of people also on the invite list. This means, for
  example, if an entire mud is excluded and one player is invited, that
  player can use the channel, but the rest of the mud can't.

- Closed. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel), but by default they will not hear or be able to use
  it. People on the invite list can use the channel, with the exception of
  people also on the exclude list.

- Private. Identical to closed, except that the channel is actually only
  physically sent to those muds that are on the invite list. This is good
  for channels specific to a small group of muds, and not of interest to
  the majority of the network.

ICHAN
Syntax:  ichan               - display current ICE channel status
         ichan <localname>   - toggle an ICE channel

IChan lets you show and toggle which ICE channels you are listening
to. Without arguments, it will show you the channels you belog to; with
an argument, it will turn on or off that channel.

Any channels you listen to must be locally configured first - see
ISETUP. ILIST can be used to see available channels.

See also: IMC ICE ILIST ISETUP
#0
ICOMMAND
Syntax:          icommand <command> <channel> [<data..>]
Common commands:  create <channel>           - create a channel
                  refresh <channel>          - refresh channel data
                  list [<channel>]           - list available commands
                  destroy <channel>          - destroy a channel
                  policy <channel> <policy>  - change channel policy
                  addop <channel> <name>     - add a channel operator
                  removeop <channel> <name>  - remove an operator
                  invite <channel> <name>    - add an invited name
                  uninvite <channel> <name>  - remove an invited name
                  exclude <channel> <name>   - exclude a name
                  unexclude <channel> <name> - remove an exclusion

ICommand is used to send commands to a channel daemon elsewhere on IMC.
It directly affects the channel itself - any changes made here will
affect all muds using the channel.

Since the actual commands are interpreted by the channel daemon, not your
mud, what is available may vary. To get a list of available commands, use
icommand list <nodename> for public commands, or icommand list
<node:channel> to see what commands you have for that channel.

icommand refresh asks the daemon to refresh your mud's information for a
channel, if it ever gets out of synx. Asking for a refresh of nodename:*
will refresh all channels on that daemon.

icommand create creates a new channel, with you as the owner
icommand destroy destroys a channel. You must own the channel.

icommand policy changes the basic policy of the channel (see ICE-POLICY).
You must be the owner.

icommand addop/removeop add and remove operators from a channel. You must
be the owner, and specify the operator's full user@mud name.

icommand invite/uninvite/exclude/unexcluded modify the invite and exclude
lists for a channel. You must be the owner or an operator on the channel.
Either a full user@mud or a simple 'mud' name (no @) can be specified.
See ICE-POLICY for more details.

#0
ILIST
Syntax:  ilist               - list all known ICE channels
         ilist <channel>     - list details on one ICE channel

IList displays information on channels active on ICE.
Without arguments, it will produce a display similar to:

Name            Local name      Owner           Policy
hub2:IAdmin     IAdmin          Nemon@AR        open
hub2:ICode      ICode                                    (inactive)
hub2:test       (not local)     Nemon@ARtest    private

This shows the canonical name (eg. hub2:IAdmin), the local name (eg IAdmin
- which can be used as an abbreviation in ISETUP, and which is also
the command to speak on that channel), the owner of the channel (eg.
Nemon@AR), and the channel's policy (see ICE-POLICY).

If a channel is not configured locally, it will have (not local) for its
local name.

If a channel is configured locally, but is not actually active on IMC, it
will have an (inactive) flag on it.

IList with a channel name will provide detailed information on that
channel. For example:

Channel hub2:IAdmin:
  Local name: IAdmin
  Format 1:   (IAdmin) %s: %s
  Format 2:   (IAdmin) %s %s
  Level:      102

  Policy:     open
  Owner:      Nemon@AR
  Operators:  Drylock@AR
  Invited:    NiceGuy@SomeMud
  Excluded:   SomeMud

This displays the channel name, local name, policy, and owner, as above. It
also displays:

- the minimum level needed on your mud to see the channel

- the format for displaying messages from the channel. These can contain
  any color codes etc. that your mud uses.

  Format1 is the string displayed when someone speaks normally on the
  channel - the first %s is replaced by their name, the second %s by what
  they say.

  Format2 is a similar string for emotes. Again the first %s is their name,
  the second %s the text of their emote.

- any operators for the channel. This can only be changed by the owner of
  the channel. Operators can modify the 'invited' and 'excluded' fields
  via the ISETUP command.

- the invited and excluded people on the channel. See ICE-POLICY for
  more details.

IMC
IMC (Inter-Mud Communication) provides a way for muds to connect together and
share various services: chat channels, tells, notes, who listings, and so on.

The available mortal-level IMC commands are as follows. See the help topics
for each of these for more information.

- IMCLIST : get a list of active muds that are connected to IMC.
- RCHAT   : send a message on the common chat channel.
- RWHO    : send a who request to a mud.
- RTELL   : send a tell to someone on another mud.
- RREPLY  : reply to a rtell from someone on another mud.
- RQUERY  : ask for information of some type from another mud.
- RBEEP   : "beep" another player. Use sparingly.
- RWHOIS  : find someone on IMC
- RFINGER : get information about a player on another mud
- ISTATS  : get some (interesting?) stats about IMC.
- RCHAN   : show which channels you are listening to, and modify that state.

There is also provision for inter-mud notes/mail; see 'IMC NOTES'.

IMC2 was written by Oliver Jowett <oliver@sa-search.massey.ac.nz>, aka
Spectrum. Mail me if you're interested in connecting to the IMC network.

         imclist direct           - get a list of directly connected muds
         imclist config           - see the local IMC config

'imclist' lists active muds on IMC. It lists all the muds which this mud knows
about on the IMC network, and when they were last heard from. The 'route'
section is mainly for diagnostics, and indicates the route that your mud will
send packets via to get to another mud.

'imclist direct' shows direct connections from your mud to other muds.

'imclist config' shows the local IMC configuration and state.

INVIS
Usage: invis [level]

INVIS sets your invisibility level.  With no argument, invis toggles between

#101
ISETUP
Syntax: isetup add <ice-channel> <localname>   - add a channel
        isetup delete <localname>              - delete a channel
        isetup rename <oldname> <newname>      - rename a channel
        isetup format1 <localname> <format>    - change format1 on a channel
        isetup format2 <localname> <format>    - change format2 on a channel
        isetup level <localname> <level>       - set channel level

ISetup allows you to change the local configuration of an ICE
channel. None of these commands have a lasting effect on the channel's
configuration on other muds.

ISetup add begins the configuration of a channel. It connects the
specified ice-channel (of the form nodename:channelname) to a local name.
For example: isetup add hub2:IAdmin IAdmin. The local name is also the
command used to speak on the channel.

When the channel is added, various default values are filled in for
format1, format2, and level.

ISetup delete removes this link. It does not affect the channel itself;
it just deletes the local configuration link for the channel.

ISetup rename changes the local name of a channel. It does not affect the
channel name itself for other muds - just the command used locally to
access it.

ISetup format1 and format2 change how a channel is displayed locally.
Each format string must have exactly two %s's within it (this is checked
for) - the first will be replaced by the speaker's name, the second by
whatever they say. Format1 is used for normal speech, format2 for emotes.
See ILIST for more information.

ISetup level sets the minimum level necessary on your mud to hear or use
the channel.

LINK
A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#0
LIST
Usage: list [item type]

list.

MISSION
   `RMissions`n are games for players run by AvP Mission Ops.  Players must
type `Bmission`n to toggle on their (`mmission`n) flag.  Once a player has this
flag they can see and type on the mission channel.  To use this channel the
command is `Bmsay`n.  Be aware that the channel will only be used for missions
broadcasts and participation, and irrelevant chatting will result in muting
of the person(s) involved.  Missions are run periodically by staff, not on
request.  If you request for missions to be run, they will not be.  Most
missions reward players with tokens: `BHelp Token`n for more information.  
Below is a list of the missions that are currently run on AvP.

players.

PK PLAYER-KILLING KILLING PLAYER_KILLING
`cPK`n is short for `cplayer killing`n and is one of the key elements of AvP.
Players may gain `cmission points`n by engaging other players in combat as an 
alternate to non player characters.  Typically, a player attacks players of 
other races. In `cPK`n, the winning player receives `cMPs`n equal to the killed
player's level.

Example:

     >`y [`bINFO`y]`n Red killed by Dragon at `KA Large Metal Room`n.
     > `wRed is level 20, so Dragon receives 20 `cMPs`n.

Note that there are `cMP`n penalties for killing players who are lower level
than the kill by 20 levels or more. The `cMP`n earned is reduced.

Also note that when a player attacks a player of his own race, he receives a
`cTRAITOR`n flag, prohibiting him from gaining any `cMPs`n until he dies.  

In addition, if a player kills an allied player as a traitor, then he will
lose `cMP`n as punishment.

PREDATOR PREDS YAUTJA

The Yautja race, commonly known as Predators due to their extremely merciless
habit of hunting other sentients, are an intelligent, humanoid life form.
Their militaristic society and mindset have allowed the yautja to perfect the
art of battle, in both melee and ranged combat.  Because of the rigorous
lifestyle of this race, only the fittest survive their beginning years.
Consequently, they tend to be physically superior to many other races.  While
powerful, fast and physically dominating, Yautja tend to have a rather
arrogant mindset towards other sentient races, often referring to them as
"meat". Hence, they can often be surprised by races they see as inferior or
merely prey.  This tends to give a lower than average perception rating.
Also, Yautja society is static, it is said to have peaked many millennia ago.

Their hardiness is, bar none, incredible, hence they have extremely high
stamina.  In both strength and agility, they are well versed, since in their
society, there is little choice but to be.  The Yautjas have developed a
technology that is unknown to any other race, which allows them to become
invisible at will, allowing them to sneak up on their prey.

Yautja hunt in small packs, or alone - depending on the prey.  They live for
the hunt, and therefore only hunt other species they deem worthwhile - a
requirement being that the opponent be able to fight back.  To kill something
that cannot defend itself is dishonorable.

Note that a Yautja may only hunt in groups with members of his own pack.
Joining the hunts of other packs is a strict violation of the practice
behind hunting itself.  Those few Yautja who claim independence from
all packs are subject to the same practices as well.

PURGE
Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

RBEEP
Syntax:  rbeep <player@mudname>     - "beep" a player over IMC

rbeep sends an audible beep to another player on another mud (the @mudname
part indicates which mud; see 'imclist'). Note that this should only be done
when you _really_ need to get their attention; abusing rbeep will usually
lead to your IMC priviliges being revoked.

See also: IMC IMCLIST
#0
RCHANNELS RCHAN RINVIS
Syntax:  rchannels                  - display your current IMC channel state
         rchannels +<channel>       - turn on an IMC channel
         rchannels -<channel>       - turn off an IMC channel

rchannels on its own will show you which IMC channels you have access to, and
whether they are currently on or off.

rchannels with an argument will turn on or off a given IMC channel that you
have access to.

rchannels can also be used to block rtells and rbeeps if necessary.

One additional option is rinvis. rchannels +rinvis will make you totally
invisible to IMC: you cannot be contacted by rtell, rreply, or rbeep, and
you do not appear on rwho. However, you cannot use any IMC channels while
rinvis is active (you can still hear them, though). rchannels -rinvis will
reverse this state.

Immortals may allow you access to IMC channels, or revoke your access to 
them, as necessary.

See also: IMC RCHAT RBEEP RTELL
#0
RCHANSET
Syntax:  chanset <player>             - see a players current IMC flags
         chanset <player> +<channel>  - set 'allow' flag on a player
         chanset <player> -<channel>  - set 'deny' flag on a player
         chanset <player> =<channel>  - reset allow/deny flags on a player

This command allows you to view or change a players IMC channel priviliges.
In all cases <channel> can be the name of an IMC channel (rchat, rcode, etc)
or 'rtell' or 'rbeep'.

Setting the allow flag for a channel allows that player to see and use that
channel, regardless of their level. This can be used, for example, to give
mortals with coding experience access to rcode.

Setting the deny flag for a channel prevents that player from using or
seeing that channel, even if their level normally allows them to. This can be
used as a penalty for players who abuse the IMC channels or rtell/rbeep.

Resetting the allow/deny flags simply clears them, using only the player's
level to determing whether they can use the channel.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' RCHAT RCODE RIMM RINFO
#0
RCONNECT
Syntax:  rconnect <mudname>                - start an IMC connection

rconnect will initiate a connection to the given mud. Note that this has to
be a _directly_ connected mud (ie. a mud in the first section of imclist).
Feedback on the state of the connection will be logged to 'wiznet imc', and 
you may want to check imclist to see if it was successful.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL' RDISCONNECT
#0
RDISCONNECT
Syntax:  rdisconnect <mudname>             - terminate an IMC connection

rdisconnect reverses rconnect, severing all connections to the named mud.

`GUsage`n: `crescue`n <target>

This command is useful if you want to try and make an attacker hit you
instead of the target it is currently attacking.  Note that you can only turn
one target for each attempt.  This is very useful in groups.

RESIGN
This command is used for clan members who wish to leave their current clan.
To leave their clan all you must do is type RESIGN. And you are then
unaffiliated with any clan.

RESTORE
Usage: restore <player | mobile>

RESTORE restores a player or mobile to full hit, mana, and movement points.
If used on immortals, it also sets all skill levels to 100%.

RETURN
Usage: return

RETURN returns you to your regular body if you are switched into a mob.

RFINGER
Syntax:  rfinger <player@mudname>     - get information about a player

'rfinger' asks the specified mud for information about the specified player.
The information you will get back (and even its existance) depends on the
remote mud, but will typically give at least their last login time.

See also: IMC RWHO RWHOIS
#0
RIGNORE
Syntax:  rignore                           - list current rignores
         rignore ignore  <pattern>         - ignore player(s) or mud(s)
         rignore notrust <pattern>         - don't trust player(s) or mud(s)
	 rignore delete  <pattern>         - remove a rignore

rignore ignores or restricts the access, at a mud-wide level, everything
coming in over IMC for a specified player or group of players. Currently
two possible actions are possible: ignore and notrust.

Ignore means:

- rtells/rbeeps/rwhos will be ignored, and a rtell sent back to say that the
  mud is ignoring them.
- no messages from them on rchat, rcode, etc will appear on your mud.

Notrust means:

- any rwho/rfinger/etc requests from a mud/player matching the pattern will
  be treated as if they were from a level 1 mortal - ie. wizi imms will never
  be revealed on rwho, and rtells won't see them, etc.
- any incoming channel messages from something matching the pattern are
  stripped of wizi status - they will be visible to everyone in general.

Patterns can be one of:

  player@mud              - matches a specific player at a specific mud
  *suffix                 - matches anything ending with that suffix
                            (commonly used as *@mud)
  prefix*                 - matches anything beginning with that prefix
                            (for example, player@*)
  *substring*             - matches anything containing that substring

Use with care.

ROOMFLAGS
Usage: roomflags

Toggles a flag which causes the virtual room number and room flags, if any,
to be displayed next to room names.
#11
RQUERY
Syntax:  rquery <mudname> help         - ask for available rquery options
         rquery <mudname> <option>     - ask for information from a mud

RQuery is similar to rwho, except it requests different information from a
mud. Each mud differs in what information it supplies, but 'rquery <mudname>
help' will give you a list of options that you can ask for.

Typically at least the following are supported:

rquery <mud> who        - ask for a who listing, identical to 'rwho'
rquery <mud> info       - get general information on the mud, usually including
                          its address. This is the preferred way of finding
                          out the address of a mud on IMC - don't ask on rchat!
rquery <mud> list       - ask for a list of IMC connections, from that mud's
                          point of view. Identical to 'imclist' on the remote
                          mud.
rquery <mud> istats     - ask for some IMC statistics, identical to 'istats' on
                          the remote mud.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RWHO
#0
RSOCKETS
Syntax:  rsockets                   - display IMC socket usage

rsockets displays the current connection state for the direct IMC connections
that your mud has. The various fields are:

Desc  : the system-level descriptor used for this connection

Mud   : which mud this connection is for

State : how far through the connection process this connection is:
        - connecting: waiting for the other end to accept our TCP connection
        - wait1:      waiting for the password from an incoming client
        - wait2:      waiting for the server to respond to our password
        - connected:  the connection is completely 'up'

Inbuf : the size of data waiting in the input and output queues for this
Outbuf: connection.

Spam1 : spam-protection counters
Spam2 :

RSTAT
RSTAT shows room stats, just like 'STAT ROOM', but allows you to stat 
remote rooms.  If no room is specified, you will see the stats of the 
room you are currently in.

rstat [room #]

> rstat
> rstat 3001

See also:  OSTAT MSTAT ZSTAT
#0
RTELL RREPLY
Syntax:  rtell <player@mudname> <message>    - send a 'tell' to another player
         rreply <message>                    - send a 'tell' to the last player
                                               to send you a rtell

rtell and rreply are the IMC equivalents of tell and reply, and work nearly
identically. To rtell, however, you need to supply both a playername and a
mudname (as shown in 'imclist'). rreply will reply to the last rtell you
received from a player - even if that player was invisible to you.

See also: IMC IMCLIST
#0
RWHO
Syntax:  rwho <mudname>               - ask for a who listing from another mud

'rwho' asks the given mud for a 'who' listing of its current players. Depending
on the network, it may take several seconds to get a response. You should use
the mud abbreviation listed in 'imclist' when issuing a rwho.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RQUERY RWHOIS
#0
RWHOIS
Syntax:  rwhois <playername>          - find a player on IMC

'rwhois' asks all muds on IMC for a player with the given name. You should not
include a @mudname section - just the playername. Replies will be returned
from those muds who have a player by that name connected.

See also: IMC RWHO RFINGER
#0
SAVE SAVEFILE
Usage: save

Save your persona.  This includes mission points, strength, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose all your lootable objects, which will stay in the game, 
with your corpse.
#0
SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT
`GUsage`n: `csay`n | `cshout`n | `ctell`n  <player> | `cwhisper`n  <player> | `cask`n <player> 

Each channel operates differently.  `cSay`n is heard by all players in the 
same room as you, `cshout`n is heard by all in the same zone, `ctell`n is a
private message sent to anyone online, `cwhisper`n and `cask`n are private
messages sent to a player in the same room as you.
Examples:

  > `wsay hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz`n
  > `wtell catje hi, how are you`n

Note, if a mob receives your `ctell`n instead of the intended player, place a
`cperiod`n (`c.`n) before the player's name.

  > `Wtell .rage hello`n

SEDIT
Usage: sedit [save] < vnum | zone >

SEDIT is used to edit shops.
SEDIT SAVE <zone> will save zone's shop file.

#11
SELL
Usage: sell [#] <item>
       sell <#>.<item>

If you'd like to sell an item to a shopkeeper, trying selling it to them.
Most shops specialize in what they will buy, so you may have to look around
to find a buyer for your items.
 
Examples:
 
  > sell sword       (sell the first sword in your inventory)
  > sell 3 sword     (sell the first three swords in your inventory)
 
See also: BUY, LIST, SHOPS, VALUE
#0
SET
Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

SHOOT SHOOTING SNIPE SNIPING 
`GUsage`n: `cshoot`n <name> |<direction>|

Shoots a ranged weapon at a named target in a nearby room.  You must
be able to see the target from your current position.

To use `cshoot`n, you must have a ranged weapon, and it must be loaded if
it takes ammo.  Ranged weapons have different maximum ranges.

Also, shoot can take the option of a specific direction.

Example: `wshoot alien east`n

SHOPS
Shops are the physical locations at which items are sold throughout the
MUD. The most common thing sold is "MEQ", which stands for Mission Equip-
ment. This is the equipment you purchase with mission points that stays
in your inventory/equipped even when you die. Note that if there are level
restrictions in place, it is illegal to purchase or possess MEQ unless you
meet the requirements.

SHOW
Usage: show <mode> [argument]

Valid Modes:

death          errors         godrooms       houses
player         rent           shops          stats
zones   

The SHOW command displays information.  Some modes of show require additional
information, such as a player name.

   death: Shows all death traps in the game.
  errors: Shows errant rooms.
godrooms: Shows the rooms in the 'god zone'.
  houses: Shows the houses that are currently defined.
  player: Shows player summary information, simply provide a player name.
    rent: Shows the filename and path to a players rent file.
   shops: Shows all the shops in the game and their buy/sell parameters.
   stats: Shows game status information including players in game, mobs etc.
   zones: Shows all the zones in the game and their current reset status.
          An age of -1 means it is in the 'to be reset next' queue.

#0
SHUTDOWN
Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.
#0
skillset
Usage: skillset <name> '<skill>' <value>

Sets the specified skill to the specified value.

#102
SLEEP REST HEALING
`GUsage`n: `csleep`n
       `crest`n

Use `csleep`n and `crest`n to heal more quickly.  The `csleep`n
command is the most effective, allowing you to regain hit and move
points the quickest.  You will be largely unaware of your surroundings
while asleep and will also be unable to perform many tasks.
You can awaken yourself with the `cwake`n command.

`cRest`n allows you to regain hit and move points quicker than normal
but slower than sleep.  The benefit of rest is the ability to perform
save those that require you to be standing.  Type `cstand`n to get up
from resting.

SLOWNS
Usage: slowns

Toggles whether or not IP addresses are resolved into readable site names.
If slow nameserver is enabled, USERS will show only IP addresses.
(128.123.222.111 etc).

See also: USERS
#0
SNEAK
Sneak allows a player to move undetected in any direction.

Sneak is now automatically activated for a player by way of any MEQ that
has the affect on it.  MEQ will be updated in the future to indicate on its
description if it has the sneak affect.

SNIPE SNIPING
Usage: shoot <person> <direction>

This command is used to shoot people who are in a room adjacent to
you.  You must be wielding a weapon and the weapon must be
loaded.

Example: 

  > `wshoot jasper west`n
#0
SNOOP
Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command; 
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.
#0
SOCIALS

`GUsage`n: <social> [<target>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.

Example:

  > `wshake homer`n
  > `wapplaud marge`n
  > `wstare`n

The `cSOCIALS`n command generates a listing of all available socials.

  > `wsocials`n

STAT
Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people with
names such as Red or Cityguard.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the playerfile.

Examples:

  > stat fido
  > stat player red
  > stat mobile red
  > stat file niandra
  > stat object thunderbolt

See also: VSTAT
#101
STEAL
Usage: steal <item> <victim>

Use steal to steal items from people.  The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is now illegal to steal from other
players.  Doing so will get you a flag for your trouble.

Examples:

  > steal gold drunk
  > steal sword mercenary
    (If it's wielded, only possible if he is sleeping)

See also: FLAGS
#0
STRING
Usage: string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>] 
WHEN RESTRINGING A ITEM ALLWAYS PUT THE WORD STRING IN THE NAME ie.
string <type> <name> name <string> + string
For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The
format is:
Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)
Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.
All things can now be restrung using the string command.
#0
SWITCH
Usage: switch <monster>

SWITCH is used to take over the body of mobiles; useful for interactive
adventures.  If the monster in which you are switched is killed you will be
returned to your own body.

SYNTHETICS SYNTHS
A Synthetic, or Artificial Person, as they prefer to be called, is a
synthetically manufactured human being, made of computer components and
various artificial organs.  In the past, the Geneva Convention prohibited
synthetics from being equipped with weapons or uninhibited combat abilities.
With the discovery of the parasitic xenomorphs and the attacks by the
predatory Yautja alien, this has changed, and synthetics have played a more
important role in combat.

The modern synthetic is a highly complex machine: stronger, faster and better
co-ordinated than an average human.  Despite these differences, military
synthetics are also made to be virtually indistinguishable in appearance from
a human.
 
Like the humans, most synthetics are affiliated with the Colonial Marine
Corps (CMC) and the Colonial Marine Airborne Regiments (CMAR), which
supply most of their equipment.

Being stronger and faster than humans, they are more capable of surviving
on their own in combat situations.  They are also able to withstand more
damage before reaching a non-functional state, and they are not affected by
pain.  However, being artificial constructs, and lacking living body tissue,
they have no regenerative process, and are therefore unable to heal.

`cSynthetic Uniqueness`n
   * 1100 Base Hp
   * +5 Hp per point of Health
   * No Automatic Healing
   * Immune to BLEED (despite leaking fluids)
   * `GSprint`n skill
   * Use of the `bUSCMC synthetic personnel cranium with `n`badvanced-function CPU`n

SYSLOG
Usage: syslog [off | brief | normal | complete]

The SYSLOG command controls how detailed of an on-line system log you see.
Messages surrounded by '[' and ']' are syslog messages and are in green
if you have color on.

The messages you receive are level dependent.

Examples:

  > syslog complete
  > syslog off

TEDIT
Usage: `wtedit`n <file>

The files you can edit with this are, news, motd, imotd, help, 
info, background, and policies.  

Example:

  > `wtedit imotd`n
#0
TIME
Usage: time

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#0
TITLE
The `clevel`n command displays the pre-assigned titles given to players at a
certain level for a player's race.

If a player wishes to have a customized title, they should not ask the staff,
but should go to the Title Restring mob at the Weyland Yutani Installation at
6-6-6.

Note that a customized title is reset upon promoting to a new level, UNLESS
a player promotes at the Title Restring mob, or at their racial recall. A player can also reset their
title by typing `cdefault`n at the Title Restring mob.

MEQ
`bMEQ`n is short for `bMission Equipment`n. `bMEQ`n is special equipment that must
be purchased, unlike the free equipment that can be found in storage
containers, on the ground, and on mobs.  `bMEQ`n is unique and valuable 
because it is both very powerful and it has the benefit of remaining with 
your character whenever you die.  `bMEQ`n is sold at various shops throughout
the race recall zones.

At `GLevel 21`n, `bMEQ`n becomes class specific, in that by wearing a certain
set of MEQ, a player becomes that class.  For example, wearing Sniper `bMEQ`n
classes a player as the Sniper class.  Classes are only decided by MEQ.

`bMEQ`n is purchased with `cMPs`n (`cMission Points`n). `cMPs`n double for what on other
MUDs would be exp and gold. As you kill more mobs and players, you gain
more `cMPs`n. To see how many `cMPs`n you have, type "`cgold`n". At any `bMEQ`n shop,
you can use the command "`clist`n" to see what `bMEQ`n is being sold, and how much
it costs. Use "`cbuy #`n" to purchase a `bMEQ`n item, be it armor, weapons, or other.

Other types of MEQ are Skill MEQ and Gadgets (SMEQ), Clan MEQ (CMEQ), Hunt
MEQ (HMEQ), and Weyland-Yutani MEQ (WYMEQ).

MP MPS GOLD EXP MISSION POINTS
`G`cMission Points`n`n, known as `cMPs`n, are `c`nAvP`n's standard for money (gold) and
experience points. You gain `G`cMPs`n`n from killing players and mobs, and can

ATV AUTOMATED TRANSPORT VESSEL

The `GATV`n (added `c12`n`y/`n`c05`n`y/`n`c00`n) is a ship used to convey cargo from one marine base
to another through the expanse of space. It journeys to Earth, Yaut, Ceres,
LV-426, and then back to Earth again in a continuous loop.
 
This process takes approximately `R3 minutes`n, so if you wait long enough where
it lands, you'll be sure to catch it. Here are the aliases:
 
`GAliens - An Isolated Valley (LV-426)`n
`calias atv w;w;w;w;enter t;w;e;e;e;s`n
`GPreds - The Base of A Waterfall (Yaut)`n
`calias atv n;n;n;n;n`n
`GHumans - Road through the compound (Earth)`n
`calias atv e;e;e;s;s;s;d;e;e;n;n;n;n;n;n`n

Synths naturally do not have easy access to the `GATV`n. If you are a synth and
need to get anywhere, go one south (from recall), all up, and all north.
Sit down, and use drive (`whelp drive`n).

newb newbie beginner

`y   Every race has a basic set of beginner, or newbie MEQ, that players can
use until they reach level 11.  The MEQ is not the best, but it is better
than the standard EQ that can be found.  Newbie MEQ is generally cheap, with
enough kick to aid in mobkilling, but not a whole lot of help when it comes
to fighting high level players or mobs.  

`GAlien Newbie MEQ`y: east, east, east, east, north from alien recall.

more you need. To see how many `GMPs`n you have on-hand, type "`wmp`n".

About AvP: The MUD
------------------

**********************************************************************
IMPORTANT NOTE:
    Though it bears a strong resemblance to the AvP of old, the combat
system on this MUD is brand new.  PLEASE TREAT IT AS A NEW MUD!  Things 
will be changing as we rework balance, add new features, and generally 
try to improve the game.  PLEASE BEAR WITH US!
**********************************************************************

LEVELS:
    Levels must be bought with Mission Points (MP).  To see how many
MP's you currently need to level, type 'promote'.  To gain a level, 
type 'promote #', where # is the next level you wish to promote to.
You will gain practices each level which can be used to practice skills.

NEW STATS:
    Coordination   - General combat accuracy
    Agility        - General evasive ability, stealth ability
    Strength       - Close quarters fighting damage, carrying capacity
    Perception     - Situational awareness
    Knowledge      - General education, Ability to learn
    Health         - Stamina and Life (HP)

Contrary to what some people will want to believe, there is no
perfect way to spend your 50 extra points.  All stats are important.
 
STRENGTH/CARRY:
    You can only carry so much before it starts to weigh you down.
Once your carrying capacity has been reached, you will no longer
be able to carry extra items in your inventory.

MODE:
    There are now three (3) different combat stances in which to fight
in - Offensive, Normal, and Defensive.  Offensive will afford more
combat damage at the expense of dodging, Normal will give a balanced
ratio of damage to evasion, and Defensive will give extra evasion at
the expense of damage.  You cannot change modes during actual combat.
Weapon speeds are also dependant on which combat mode you are fighting
in.  To switch modes, simply type 'mode <mode name>', where <mode name>
is Offensive, Normal, or Defensive.

THROW:
    Certain items can now be thrown by simplying using throw <victim>.
Thrown items will be destroyed once they hit their target, but will
stay in existence if they miss.  Note that throw <victim> <direction>
will still work if a specific victim in a specific room is desired.

LOCATIONAL DAMAGE:
    Bullet arcs are now tracked across the body and can hit any several
body parts.  If an attack round strikes a certain body part, only the
armor covering that part will be used to defend against the strike.

SKILLS:
    Typing 'practice' will show a list of the skills your character
can currently learn, as well as their current proficencies.  For more
information on any given skill, type 'help <skill name>'.

SPRAY
`yAvailable Skill`n: `GSPRAY`n

`GUsage`n: `cspray`n <direction>

Some weapons can be used in 'suppressive' fire mode.  It will eat
up ammo quickly, and is completely unaimed.  However, it can hit multiple 
targets located in the specified room, including hidden and invisible
players.

The range of `cspray`n is dependent upon the range of the weapon.  This skill
is much more effective when attacking multiple targets.

Spray is tied to your weapon's shooting timer, and so cannot be used
immediately after shooting.

STATS STRENGTH AGILITY HEALTH COORDINATION PERCEPTION ATTR
`cStrength`n     - Physical strength, melee damage bonus different per weapon,
               increases carrying capacity
`cHealth`n       - Vitality, increases hitpoints at a race-specific rate
`cCoordination`n - Hand-eye coordination, critical for all combat skills
`cAgility`n      - Ability to move quickly, critical to the Dodge skill
`cPerception`n   - Awareness of your surroundings, critical for Stealth 
               and Notice skills
`cKnowledge`n    - General intelligence and education, benefits knowledge
               based skills like Engineering and Demolitions

Note that bonuses occur when the attribute reaches a required level.  These
levels are known as tiers, which the staff is not to share, but many players
already know through their own discovery.

Stats work hand in hand with their skills listed on `cprac`n.  Skills are
much more important to train up than stats.

Use the `cattr`n command to view your current statistics not found in the 
`cscore`n screen.  Note that these statistics can be trained at your race recall 
using the `cpractice`n command, and reduced using `cunpractice`n

#101
oldsalary
For future reference, the period of one week (Monday-Sunday) will be 
defined as the 'work week'.

All active staff members will receive an allotted salary of 1000 MP 
per 'work week' to be divided between their mortal characters however 
they see fit. Inactivity or unproductivity for a week will result in 
the forfeiture of said salary for that week.

Inactivity is defined as:

A) Not logging during the 'work week'.
B) Logging on during the 'work week' and being unproductive.

Note that activity is NOT defined entirely by simply showing up - you 
must show up AND be productive. Productivity will be taken into 
account if your login availability is limited during the 'work week' -
for instance, if you are only able to log in once or twice during 
the week and finish an exceptional amount of work during those login 
periods, that will count as activeness/productivity.

Staff
-----
All staff members are expected to help improve staff-player 
relations, run missions, and process player ideas to be passed along 
through the staff ranks, in addition to any other duties assigned if 
they wish to be eligible for weekly salary. Failure to perform these 
basic duties will result in forfeiture of salary for any given work 
week. However, these conditions can be neglected in favor of being 
paid by building commission, but conditions for both must be met to 
receive both rewards.

Some conditions for forfeiture of basic salary:

A) Logging on just to talk to people.
B) Refusal to run missions for players.
C) Knowingly allowing illicit activity to take place.
D) Failure to perform other duties as assigned.

Building
--------
Building will be rewarded on a commission basis; that is, for every 
building project finished, the project will be evaluated and MP will 
be awarded for the depth of complexity and quality present in the 
project. All staff should note that building is OPTIONAL, and that 
they will NOT receive basic salary if they neglect their basic 
staffing duties.

Building Commission Conditions:

1. The completion of a zone (30-75 rooms) that is deemed worthy of 
placement in the mud: 3k MP. Extra MP will be allotted based on 
the quantity and quality of the zone above and beyond the 
basic building requirements.

2. The completion of a mission zone (25+ rooms) that is deemed worthy 
of use: 2k - 3k MP. Extra MP will be allotted based on the 
quantity and quality of the mission zone above and beyond 
the basic building requirements. Building a 25 room zone with 
only linked rooms and calling it an 'arena' is not acceptable for 
this offer.

3. The completion of any lesser building (equipment, vehicles, basic 
zone upkeep or revision, etc.): To be determined by the salary 
administrator, and generally should not exceed 2k MP.
----------

Punitive actions taken against staff who bend or break regulations 
may include forfeiture of salary for a period to be determined by the 
administrator meting out the punishment.

This stuff isn't half as hard as it sounds, folks. Just log on every 
now and then, do some work, and you'll get paid - don't log on, don't 
work, and you won't be paid. It's as simple as that.

DEVOUR
`yAvailable Skill: `GDEVOUR`n

`GUsage`n: `cdevour`n <corpse>

`ba flesh rending extendable inner jaw`n
`ba muscular inner jaw with sharpened gorestained teeth`n

Devour is a regenerative skill that allows one to devour the corpse of a 
slain prey while restoring health in an alert state.  For each corpse 
devoured, an alien will regain a certain percentage of health.  Keep
in mind that while devouring you can perform no other actions - if you do,
you will destroy the corpse.

The 'Natural Abilities' skill increases the amount of hitpoints regained by
devouring a corpse.  Devouring mob corpses halves the amount of
hitpoints that can be regained.

Devour is gained at `GLEVEL 11`n.

`YTier 1: Mature Alien

`GDevour`y: By use of this skill, an alien can feed upon enemies it had killed to
   replenish its strength and vitality. The corpses of mobs will heal the
   Alien only half of what player corpses will.
Syntax: `Gdevour corpse `y(`G#`y)

   escaping.
Syntax: `Gtailwhip `y<`Gtarget`y>

`GMetabolism`y: With this ability, the chemical processes in the Xenomorph are
   greatly accelerated. The Xenomorph's HP and MV restoration rates are
   improved by 33%.
Passive Ability.

`GStrength Hiving`y: The Drone can secrete strength-augmenting hiving. Any
   friendly Xenomorphs in the same room as the strength resin will notice a
   sizable boost to their physical power. The hive command begins the
   secretion of the resin.
Syntax: `Gsecrete `y<`Gresin type`y>
Syntax: `Ghive

`YTier 3: Praetorian

`GSneak`y:  Making use of its instinctive stealth capabilities, a fully matured
   drone can sneak past enemies, often undetected.
Passive Ability.

`GPounce`y: Drawing upon its naturally superior speed and strength, the Xenomorph
   can launch itself at a target, digging its claws in and knocking the
   senseless victim to the ground. This also initiates combat with the target
   if the Alien is not already fighting.

`YTier 1: Juvenile

`GCull`y: When confronted with overwhelming numbers, a Xenomorph will find it
   advantageous to divide his enemies and slaughter them one by one. Cull
   allows the Alien to pick the weakest member of the group and drag them
   away from his comrades.
Syntax: `Gcull `y<`Gdirection`y>

`GFast Weapon Proficiency`y: Allows use of `ba pair of wickedly grooved claws
   coated in biological effluence.
Passive Ability.

`GLeap`y: Aliens are renowned for their speed and reflexes. By using this ability
   the player can leap through the air, jumping over obstacles or enemies who
   stand in its way. The alien can leap a maximum distance of three rooms.
Syntax: `Gleap `y<`Gdirection`y> <`Gdistance`y>
Note: The distance argument is optional. If no distance is set, the player
   will leap 2 rooms.

`YTier 2: Minion

`GRake`y: When armed with sharp claws, the Warrior can slash downwards, tearing
   through armor and flesh.
Syntax: `Grake `y<`Gtarget`y>
You must be locked in melee with your target before you can attempt to use
   this ability.

`GWallclimb`y: The Alien can climb onto the walls and ceiling, hidden from view.
   Wallclimb allows you to start climbing the walls. Wallclimb down will
   allow you to move normally again. Be aware that climbing on the ceiling is
   much more strenuous than walking on the ground.
`GSyntax: `Gwallclimb
`GSyntax: `Gwallclimb down

`YTier 3: Nightmare

`GSerrated Claws`y: A fully grown Xenomorph warrior can use its great strength
   to grow fully sized talons, allowing the use of `ba pair of serrated 
   talons, gruesomely adorned with rotting viscera`y. Although they require
   investment in the Heavy Weapons skill, they offer greater damage and
   use a warrior's great strength more to its advantage.

`GEviscerate`y: Eviscerate is similar to pounce, except it can be done from afar.
   Cunning Aliens can leap through the air and land on top of a target in an
   adjacent room. The helpless target, stunned from the impact, is more often
   than not dismembered on the spot by the celeritic Xenomorph.
Syntax: `Geviscerate `y<`Gtarget`y>

classeq

`n1. Go to room 6400 and type zlist obj to view a listing of all of the
   current class eq.  Each piece of eq has a rarity varying from r1,
   being the least rare, to r4, being the most rare.  Rarity is
   generally based on the respective power of the piece of eq.  If
   you would like to view the statistics of a particular piece of eq,
   type vstat obj <vnum>.

2. Each of these pieces of eq needs to be distributed throughout the
   mud's NPC population for player consumption. Any given mob can
   be given UP TO THREE (3) different pieces of class eq to load
   when the mob is killed.  It is imperative that only 3 pieces are
   loaded on the mob, or the random load script could potentially
   error.  The load script is trigger 6490 - to use it, simply
   attach it to the desired mob and then 'give' the mob whichever
   pieces of class eq in zedit.  Make sure the give command is
   dependant on the loading of the mob.

3. An initial chanceroll is made to see which rarity will be checked
   on a potential load run.  The less rare pieces have a higher chance
   of loading initially.  Each piece is then run through a secondary
   load chance to reduce the load probability.  If both chances pass,
   an object of whichever rarity was determined by the initial roll
   will be loaded.  If there is more than one piece of equipment of
   the same rarity on the mob, the piece loaded is determined
   randomly.

4. After being loaded, the eq will have one minute to be picked
   up ("owned").  If at the end of the one minute the eq is not
   in a player's possession, the eq is purged.  This is to keep unholy
   amounts of equipment from being stacked and stashed.`n`n

combo combos
`cCOMBOS`n

`n    Combos are created by executing a proper series of moves in a row
during combat.  Each move in the combo will use a certain amount of
rage depending on its relative strength, so you will need to make sure
you have enough rage to actually complete a combo before you try it!

    Each combo has a specific purpose - some are good as general combat 
combos, some do extra damage vs. certain races, and some have special 
effects.  To see a listing of the combo skills you can use, type `cskills`n.
Once you have learned a combo, you will be able to check its move 
list by typing `ccombos`n.

    Remember - experiment with different move combinations to learn new
combos!  Combos are anywhere between 3 and 5 moves in length.  Do NOT ask 
imms for combo move lists!  WE WILL NOT TELL YOU!

`cRAGE`n

    Rage is a new attack system designed for the predator race.  With
it, a predator will be allowed to unleash a huge arsenal of
hand-to-hand based attacks.  In order to use Rage, you must obtain
the Rage armor (`bceremonial rage armor of the Yautja champion`n), and
then engage in jehdin/jehdin combat.  With each successful attack you
make against fellow players, you will gain Rage.  You can also gain
Rage from mobs, but it is an extremely limited amount.

Conditions under which you will accumulate Rage:
1. Successful attacks during pkilling (heavy accumulation)
2. Successful attacks during mobkilling (almost no accumulation)

Conditions under which you will lose Rage:
1. Showing cowardice and fleeing from battle (-20 Rage)
2. Removing your rage armor (-50 rage)

    There are two different types of special attacks you can use with
Rage - combos and deathblows.  Combos are a series of minor attacks
strung together consecutively during battle, and have a generally low
Rage cost.  Deathblows are extremly powerful attacks, but will cost
an entire Rage meter (100%) when they are used.  In relation, trophy
skulls can also be pulled from the corpses of victims you have slain
with deathblows (ONLY deathblows - you cannot take trophy skulls from
people slain by combos).
    In order to take a trophy skull, your deathblow MUST KILL YOUR
OPPONENT.  If you do not kill your victim with the deathblow, you will
not have a chance to take a skull.  If the deathblow does indeed kill
your victim, then you will have a chance to automatically pull a
trophy skull from their corpse.  Once the skull has been taken, you
must polish it to reveal either a small, medium, or large skull.  Note
that trophy skulls can only be taken from pyode amedha (marines) and
kainde amedha (xenomorph) opponents.  Small skulls are worth 1 point,
medium skulls are worth 2 points, and large skulls are worth 3 points.
Skull points can then be used to barter for elite Hunt MEQ.
    Deathblows also have a damage-type associated with them.  For 
instance, the deathblow 'disembowel' can only be used with slash-type
weapons, which include, but are not limited to: halberds, swords,
naginatas, serrated wrist blades, etc.

   * You must be in the same zone as the person who kills a player
     to earn MP for the kill
   * You will not earn MP if you are in a safe room
6. [`mRULE ENFORCEMENT`n] Clans of different races may not ally.
7. [`cBALANCE`n] When someone flees, EVERYONE in the room who was fighting them
   will now be freed from the fight or have their target redirected.  In
   addition, they can now shoot or throw immediately.
8. [FEATURE] All Core MEQ (Drone, Rifleman, Hunter) now have MEQ upgrades. 

`y9/02/04`n
1. [`cBALANCE`n] HP gain is now per point of Health.  The gain rate is race
   specific.

`y4/20/05`n
1. [`rCHANGE`n] Energy required to deskull now depends on the level difference.
   It will cost 5 + level difference if the victim is lower in level and  
   only 5 if higher.

`y7/29/05`n
1. [FEATURE] New Hunter weapon, `bsmart-disc`n, can be worn but only thrown
   with the naginata. Note - uses special weapons, not throwing.

`y8/24/05`n
1. [`cBALANCE`n] Aliens and Hunters with Skill MEQ may notice small stat boosts.
2. [`cBALANCE`n] Pred Medicomps changed.  EQ - 200hp/30% drain, MEQ - 300hp/25%,
    HMEQ - 400hp/20%

1. [FEATURE] Use `csplit # #`n at the token lady to split receipts.

`y8/29/05`n

   about) pieces are now CLASSLESS.  Riflemen can wear Sniper Support MEQ, 
   Warriors can wear Drone Support MEQ, etc.  The idea is so that players
   can customize their character more, by mixing and matching different
   sets of MEQ for different +stat/skill bonuses.  See `chelp support`n!
2. [FEATURE] Heavy Support and Warrior `bSupport MEQ`n now in game, but not
   weapons, armors, or skills.  Enjoy the new stats.

   Old Level 31 Support MEQ price was increased from 300 to 450 MPs.
3. [`rCHANGE`n] Skill Reqs on weapons removed.  Just a reminder that a lot of
   crazy changes are going on because we are trying to get away from the
   class system.  Our next step is to declass all class skills and make them 
   available to all, but divided up by both level AND skill requirement.

`y9/14/05`n
1. [FEATURE] `cCircle`n addition added.  If one's charge is 5 or above, there
   is a chance to "cripple" an opponent.  Crippling an opponent will lag his
   movement for one second over a period of six seconds.

`y9/24/05`n

   cannot do math; like Prophet.  Thanks to Vrasp!

`y10/7/05`n
1. [`rCHANGE`n] Aliens: Please note that `GPounce`n, `GTailwhip`n and `GBite`n 
   now use the 'Unarmed Combat' skill, along with Cull.  This was something
   we forgot to do when we made yesterdays changes.  This means the
   'Natural Abilities' skill has no bearing on them.  Prophet apologizes.

`y10/19/05`n
1. [FEATURE] The long awaited `bplasmacaster`n is now for sale at the Hunter 
   weapon dealer.  Thank you very much to Matthias!

ammodesignentries
[8] ADFK-6745 Type-SRX-Twelve Shockwave Stun Pellets
   Each hit has a chance of stunning your target 1-2 seconds depending on their
agility/dodge.    


[9] NAPALM MELEE WEAPON PACKS.
Napalm cartridge, loaded into the base of melee weapons which would give thermal and fire damage to the weapon.  Basically almost like having the blade of the melee weapon charged with flame, or sizzling hot.
This ammo type could result in the person catching on fire, and damage coming every so often until the person is somehow extinguished.


[11] ENERGY MELEE WEAPON PACKS.
Energy Charges, a pack which could be loaded to cause energy type damage, basicall like having a plasma which runs along the blades of a weapon.


[12] Explosive-tipped Bullets
   Each hit has a chance of exploding, doing extra damage to the target and
potentially other people in the same room as the target.    


[13] Silver bladed breaking bullets
Does blunt dmg and slsh dmg?


[15] Poisonous Spores
   Each hit has a chance of infecting the victim with a poison that slowly
slows down their targets healing rate, eventually reversing it, but wears out
after a while.    


[17] POISON MELEE WEAPON PACKS.
Poison Charge, a poison cartridge loaded into the melee weapon which could POISON! the opponent, adding an extra sort of damage which can continue to work even if the wielder of the poison weapon dies.  IE:  You are Poisoned!  OUCH! The poison wears you 

of 100 life......1 minute later OUCH! The poison wears you of 104 life, etc.
And Poison to make it more effective would make you not able to recall, and the only place to cure poison would be recall.  So you would physically have to get back to your recall in order not to die of poison.  Maybe in the form of a tablet which loads 

in recall, or just a room which removes the Poison Flag.


[18] Leg-Clockers
If the target is hit in the legs/feet with this type of bullet, their movement penalties are tripled.


[19] Awu'asa Sharpened points
maybe, created from dead corpses? thats just a idea, but the title says most of it...


[20] gelatinous ammo
   A successful hit from some gelatinous type substance would trap the victim.
They would be unable to move or defend themselves until they managed to fight
their way free.  Of course their buddies could help free them of the muck.    


[21] Napalm fuel Burner
Burns longer, lasts longer, hurts more :P kinda like poison except not for time, for everytime you move north south east or west so basically immoble unless you wanna get hurt


[24] Hollow-tipped bullets
When a successful critical strike is scored, the bullets could cause about 20% more damage than a normal critical strike.


[26] BLINDING CHARGE PACK
A pack which can be loaded and will cause blindness.  If a head shot lands, have coordination and perception drop by 25%, the blindness putting a huge toll on Combat.


[28] ADFK-6745 Enhanced Tracers
   Each hit after the first successful one has a 25% more chance of scoring a
critical strike on the target.  (Only useful if you make CS do something :P)


[29] whittled wood spikes
filled with poison, just a idea...


[31] Splinter Damage
Something that can be attached so that a weapon will splinter off.  IE when a weapon hit lands, shards of the item which was added to the weapon will splinter off of the item and imbed themselves into the skin of the opponent.  The splinters will then ca

cause more damage as the opponent makes any movements with their character.  Thus the possibility of death after killing your opponent because you have splinters in you is there.


[32] Smoke Grenade Launcher thing..
   Maybe not as an ammo type - but smoke grenades could be used to fill rooms
with vision hampering smoke.  The area would clear after a few minutes but
until then it would affect players like DARK does when they don't have a light
source.  Great fun to roll in, hide in, and so forth.    


[33] Bacteria
Spreads whenever contact with another player :P kinda like the plague, but worse


[34] Tick Bullets
   The bullets are filled with parasitic organisms, that on contact with the
target, the bullet shell snaps and they are let loose and begin to burrow deep
into the targets skin and eat him alive from the insides.    


[36] Jelly of Destruction
   Upon contact, the bullet splits open and releases some type of jelly onto
the body part the bullets hit, effectively nullifying/reducing the effects of
MEQ in that area.  (IE: If an arm MEQ gives +5 coord, and the arm gets hit with
the Jelly of Destruction only gives +2 coord)


[39] Impregnation Ammo
An ammo type which can be loaded into a weapon and which, with only a certain chance to work sucessfully, will impregnate the person inflicted with damage, which will cause their eventual death.
The chesthugger which would burst out, would eventually grow into a fullsized queen which would lay eggs which could then impregnate again.  There should be a limit on the ammount of eggs which could be layed, as the lag has been a problem with like idea

in the past.


[41] Binding Ammo
An ammo type which would cause the effected enemy to lag, or be unable to move for a certain period of time.  Somewhat like a forcefield or a web, or the goo that riot police use to slow down crowds.


[42] New Skill for the different Ammo types.
Perhaps this could also be implemented.  Have a Special Ammo Type skill added under coordination which would require better special ammo effectiveness to be determined by the special ammo skill level.


[48] JHP Pistol Rounds
   Jacketed Hollow Point Rounds, Used for stunning someone, useful when saving
hostages or capturing an enemy.    


[50] Full metal jacket
Raises the damage by 1.5, yet makes it so the kick is so fucking hard the gun is 2x as innacurate.


[52] 40mm Hollow Charge Round
   Anti-personnel, Anti-armour and Anti-fortification rounds, has a few room
radius.    


[53] Nerve agent incased bullets
   Once hitting the poor bastard target, the target finds their movementnt to
cost abnormally large amounts of MV, soon thereof 5 seconds later a constant
damage is affected on the person as they try to move into another, growing
exponentially with each moveme attempt.  Poor bastard fleers.    


[56] Bullet grains
   Well shit, each standard bullet should have a type of grain, as each grain
is incrased, as is the potential damage.  While the damage will increase, the
chance of tagging someone in the head dramatically drops to close to 0 chance,
while piercing armor that much more.  On top of this, a noticeable reduction of
chance of hit will be attached.    


[58] Ice bullets
   An actual bullet made of ice for snipers.  It doesn't reveal WHERE the
bullet came from when it hits the target, at a reduction of accuracy of each
room and the reduction of the gun's sniping ability by 1 itself.    


[60] Static-electric bullets
   Designed for predators, by snipers, does 1/4 of the gun's actual damage yet
when hitting the predator, renders the predator unable to go invisible for 2:00
minutes after hit, shorting those bastard's invisible out.    


[61] MK-345
   "Poison Bullet.  " It is hollow pointed, for massive wound damage.  It also
ontains low recoil, very high velocity, and made for penetration, not
expansion.  High amounts of damage are received.    


[63] Slugs
   The shotgun will change it's rof to an automatic 1, yet increase damage by
the original rof as a multiplier with an ADDITIONAL multiplier of 1.  25.  '
IE: The normal ammo for a shotty punches at 150 damage each rof, assuming you
hit 3...  450 damage.  Now, load the slugs and the shotty punches at 450 X 1.
25 at 1 possible ROF, penetrating deep into armor yet becoming very shitty
because 1 rof is a hell of a gamble to hit with.  With slugs, this weapon is
rendered useless at any range.    

[Also see ammodesignentries2]
#102
ammodesignentries2
[64] Speargun
   Predators are able to shoot a net at their prey, leaving their prey unable
to move for 20 seconds and unable to attack for 5 seconds, having a range of 2
and able to be fired out of the speargun.    


[73] Hollow Tracers
Holow tracers.. I got the idea, because little tracers will be implanted into the edge of a hollow point round, probably for the pulse rifle or something. After the enemy is shot, the shooter can trace the enemy anywhere, anytime, until he/she/it dies.


[74] ASFK-6745 Prototype Swarm Warheads
Every successful hit results in another, with damage decreasing every hit.


[75] ADFK-6745 Armor Nullification Pellets
Temporarily cuts armor protection in half where ever the bullets hit.


[76] Bebop Enemy Information Tracers
Each successful hit reports how much hp the target has left.


[77] CONFUSION AMMO
 When your target is hit by this ammo, there is X% chance that they will become confused.
Confusion causes your movements to randomly swap, i.e. typing north could take you south, or typing east could take you north, etc


[79] Rust-45 CMC Grenade Launcher
Rust-45 CMC Grenade Launcher that would reduce enemies armor by 30%
Would be ranged attack.
This would also be a fragmentation shot, where the shot would send schrapnel to surrounding rooms.
Attacker would get hit also with fragments.
1 shot, either hit or miss. One shot per reload
Fragmentations would hit surrounding rooms no matter if shooter hits target or not.


[80] Tracking Ammo
A shot that if after hitting imbeds itself in the skin of the opponent, will broadcast their location for a set amount of time.


[87] Flame Grenade Rounds
Flame Rounds
Causes damage to all enemies in the room. Bonus damage to aliens


[88] Depleted Uranium Shells
Depleted Uranium Shells
Very powerful sniper type ammo. Highly accuate and damaging.


[89] Gas Grenades
Gas Grenades
Fills area with damage. Affects ALL players and mobs, includeing who shot it
off. Goes away after a few ticks.


[90] Spectral Ammo
Spectral Ammo
Causes random effects on target such as: slowed movement, downed stats, extra damage, reduced armor, constant damage, ect.


[93] Yautja Net Ammo
   Any type of Net idea would work, I was thinking of a dlex crafted one
myself.  The ammo could be fired from a speargun, combi or perhaps if not a
great ammo idea a MEQ thrown weapon?  The net would drain the MV of the target
to 0, and not allow he/she to use hide/invis for a set amount of time and also
not allow the target to move for a set amount of time.    


[94] EMP Charge Canister
   A retrofit device fired from a sniper rifle perhaps.  The canister would
render the target from using Cloaking, and perhaps motion tracking if able to
do so within the codebase.    


[95] High Explosive Ammo
   I know..  I know.  We've always talked about grenade launchers, by why not?
Grenades could be loaded into a ranged weapon and fired..  Just that simple.  


[99] pulse rifle grenade launcher
   Underbarrel Grenade launcher rounds: Pulse Rifle
The M42-A Pulse Rifle already has a grenade launcher under barrel, so i propose grenade rounds be allowed to be loaded into the pulse rifle in addition to the normal rifle rounds. 
The different types of grenades are as follows:
Fragmentation: These do 1.5 times the amount of normal grenades.
Flare: These, when fired into a room, blind all players and/or mobs in the room. When a player is blinded, he/she cannot type in any commands other than chat/race talk.
Gas: These rounds do 50 damage to all players within two rooms of the targeted room, except for safe rooms.
Cluster: These rounds break into smaller grenades, each of witch does 0.5 times the amount of damage normal grenades do, but they spread across several rooms in the past the targeted room, except for safe rooms.


[102] Full Metal Jacket
1.  Full metal jacket.
This is your standard brass cased armor piercing round, like all FMJ rounds, the main
goal is to penitrate armor, as opposed to kill, perhaps it would give a small bonus to damage, 
say 10%.


[103] Explosive rounds
Grenade rounds.
Expensive and somewhat dangerous to use, grenade rounds are much like the normal bullets used, except
the hollow part of the bullet contains a high explosive which detonates upon impact.  
danger increase with the type of explosive.  Such possibilites are C4, TNT, Gunpowder, even nitogylcerin.
Notri and C4 being the strongest, and most dangerous to use, the damage would be a decent amount higher
than normal, perhaps 10-30% depending on the type of explosive.  possiblity of others nearby to be hit by
shrapnel (highly unlikely for a rifle round though,


[104] rifle rocket
Warhead round.
Picture the rifle mounted rockets used in present military forces.  These highly powerful, highly
dangerous weapons fire only once before the need to reload (and would possibly cost mps), however,
The damage dealt to the target is massive, perhaps double a normal shot, if not more.  Also, the blast may
strike people in the same room for a noticable amount of damage(perhaps 100?).  These rounds would
more than likely these shots would cost a noticeable amount of MPs due to their damage.


[105] Rubber Bullets
Rubber Bullets
Used mainly for riot control, these deal little to no real damage to the target.  However, it may
suprise or catch the target offguard.  Damage -80%


[108] Synchronized Sound Disabler Ammo
Relatively low damage, 100 damage. Gives a 2 second stun, and a -10 to perception allowing the marines to hide or retreat, affects the whole room the target is in
,allowing the marines to hide or retreat


[110] Flechette Rounds
   Rather than clusters of tiny Bullets, Flechette rounds fire scatters of
needle-like darts.  Flechettes are good at punching through light armor and
inflict considerable damage.  These would be ranged ammo capable of being
imapale damage.  If the armor value for the area hit is less than 3 perhaps the
weapon would 'bypass' the armor without taking off any of the armor bonuses.  


[111] Incin Ammo
   This ammo type could be used on almost any ranged weapon I can think of.  
Hollow-Point ammo loaded with explosive Cores, these bullets turn into a tiny
stream of superheated plasma that not only can burn through most armors but
cause massive trauma.  A ranged ammo that causes thermal damage.    


[112] Gas Grenades
Gas Grenades
A gas grenade, when used, creates a 'gas cloud' that stays in that room, and does 50 damage every 5 seconds to all players in that room for 1 minuite. Then, the cloud is mostly dissipated, and does 25 damage to the players every 5 seconds instead.


[113] Anti Xenomorph rounds
Anti-Xenomorph rounds
An anti-xenomorph round does more damage to Aliens with strong armor against ballisitic, not less.


[114] Anti-Predator rounds
Anti-Predator rounds
An anti-Predator round does more damage to Predators with strong armor against ballistic, not less.


[115] Anti-Marine rounds/weapons
Anti-Marine rounds/weps
An anti-Marine round/wep does more damage to Marines with strong overall armor, rather than less.


[120] Firefly shotgun ammo
Ok. Firefly shotgun ammo would be like an exploding shotgun ammo. On impact they explode into flames burning the target, and still causing normal bullet damage.


[121] Flare gun
A flare gun would use flares ofcourse. It could be fired one room. It would be very good against heavy and light armor alike, lodging a flare inside a victim then exploding. let's say it only holds one flare at a time, there for you would have to load an

ther flare in after every shot.


[122] Re:Flare gun
Yeah i forgot this. You would'nt have to fire at a target, but could fire it into a room. But you could also fire at a target.

[125] plasma grenades
Plasma grenades! Ok. A plasma grenade could be thrown like a normal grenade, BUT, and this is a big BUT, you could also throw it onto an enemy and it would stick to them. This could cause damage while on them until it blows up. Like burning damage or som

thing.


[127] poison dart ammo
You could shoot a dart into a victim causing a small amount of damage and poisoning them. But could only be used for smaller weapons such as pistols.


[128] pellets
A pellet would remain in a victims body causeing damage until death. not a large amount of damage but a very small amount. Cannot be removed.


[131] oil slicks
OK!!!! Oil slicks! You take a can of oil and pour it on the ground in a room. It would work like a mine sept the victim would fall down causeing damage then would have to stand up again.


[134] Shredder Brand Ammo
This ammo can be found in two types, the second will be outlined in the next post.
Type 1: Plasma Splash Cartridges
This ammo cartridge contains hot plamsa under extreme pressure.  When fired from a thermal rifle or incinerator, this ammo is thrown out of the cartride, creating a flak-cannon effect.  The damage hits every person in the room of the target.


[135] Shredder Brand Ammo (Part 2)
2. Shrapnel Flak Cartridges
When loaded into a rifle or mini-gun, this ammo rips through bodies, but quickly looses accuracy at longer ranges.  When inserted into a rifle, the range is halved, and becomes optimal at same room or 1 room.  It will damage every person in the room as t

target when fired from a rifle.  When fired from a minigun, these flak cartriges do signifcantly less damage, but affect everyone in the room.


[137] Re: those sam site guns like on the secone movie ALIENS
9mm Armor Piercing Rounds -
They're for the Sniper Rifle and they basically either have a small chance
to ignore armor in a certain body spot or just have a better chance to
do a critical shot or something.

[138] my ammO idea
Recall Disruption Ammo
causes whoever got shot by it to be unable to recall for a certain period of time.  
So people can't god dang flee/wait/recall !!!!


[137] shoot time 10mm Explode on Penetration Magazine -
shoot time 10mm Explode on Penetration Magazine -
Its probably good for a chaingun. It just has a chance of doing double
damage if it hits a low armor spot. Also maybe it does a tiny bit of
splash with just a fraction of its normal damage (probably like .10 or .20).

TOKEN TPS CASHING PACKAGE RECEIPT TOKENS
Tokens used to the primary reward for missions until WYMEQ was removed, 
which resulted in the creation of prize boxes (`chelp prizes`n).  Token 
Points, or TP, are still useful for buying unique fun items, special ammo,
or collecting Token Sets.

When you first receive your tokens, they come in a package like so:

`ya package of `cMission Tokens `yworth `c5`y points`n
 
To withdraw the tokens from the package, type `cunwrap`n.  Numerous tokens
will then be withdrawn from the package.  The tokens received are random, but
their total point value will equal the value of the package.  When unwrapping
a 5 point package, you may recieve this:

`ya '`cPredator Smart Disc`y' Mission Token (`c1`y) #32`n
`ya '`cEng. Brett`y' Mission Token (`c2`y) #48`n
`ya '`cNav. Lambert`y' Mission Token (`c2`y) #56`n

Note that the token point value of each token is found after the name of the 
token itself, such as the `y(`c2`y)`n after `ya '`cNav. Lambert`y' Mission Token`n.

Tokens can be stored in `ya `cpouch`y for `cMission Tokens`n.

To exchange your tokens into `ctoken points`n or `cTPs`n, head to the
`YW`yeyland `YY`yutani`n installation in space at 06-06-06 and take them to the young
woman found at the `cToken Exchange`n shop.  There, you can type
`csell`n  <token name>.  The woman will exchange your tokens for a receipt
which will give you `ctoken points`n.  If for some reason you acquire more than
one token receipt, type `cjoin`n to combine them.

Token points can be used to purchase various items which are all sold by
different vendors in the `YW`yeyland `YY`yutani`n installation.  Tokens are collected
for different Token Sets, such as the Alien Queen Doll or the Predator Doll,
which are very useful items.

If you wish to simply exchange your `ctoken points`n into `cmission points`n,
you can return to the young woman at the `cToken Exchange`n and type
`ccash`n <desired number of points>.  1 `cTP`n = 25 `cMP`n.

`n              Immortal Building Housing Rules:
`RIF YOU ARE NOT A HOUSING IMMORTAL, DO NOT TOUCH HOUSING!`n

- Guarana
- Sander
- Kiz

1)  Mortal houses must be conclusive with the surrounding geography and effects, but can also have
`n    fun personal extras which would make the house something you'd like to spend money on.  Such as
`n    a predator house having kegs of c'ntlip.

2)  Mortals can have an option if they wish for a roleplaying no-safe room.  This means rather than
`n    the first room you enter of their house being the actual main house, you enter one of their
`n    additional rooms which then will lead into the house.




3)  Mortals may not have overly offensive subjects in their houses.  Repeitions of such things as a
`n    giant cock is here skullfucking FearItself will not be allowed and I hope to god you kill the
    mortal for even trying it.

4)  -House locations: The do nots.
`n    -Aliens:  May not have houses located anywhere surrounding the main recall feasting area or near
`n              any shops.  They must be at least two rooms from a teleporter or ship.  They must be
`n              at least three rooms away from the marine base.
`n    -Marines:  May go basically anywhere slapped on Ceres or Earth.  They may not be situated next
`n               to any shops.
    -Yautja:  May not be connected to recall.  May not be connected to any teleporters or ships.

STUFF TO DO


MP/CP conversion rate:   50 MP -> 1 CP

Clan item costs:
-  Extra room:  100 CP
-  Extra generator:  400 CP
-  Inner defense item:  200 CP
-  Outer defense item:  100 CP
-  Perimter defense item:  100 CP
-  Extra terminal/board:  300 CP
-  Clan mobile ship:  1000 CP

Repairing a destroyed item costs half its original cost in CP.

Clan begins with:
-  core base of 8-10 rooms
-  2 inner defense items that can do up to 500 damage in total
-  1 perimeter warning script
-  1 terminal/board

1.  Clan items destructable (object HP?)
Generators -  power sources for various aspects of base
   -  1 to start, up to 4 can be bought with CP
   -  power distribution script watches generators, generators watch it
   -  once all generators are destroyed, things are disabled
   -  lights can go out?  all rooms go dark.
 Mainframe  -  controls base, once disabled the raider leeches CP
   -  locked until all other things are destroyed
   -  marines: computer, aliens: egg room, preds: trophy room
   -  opposing clan can "leech" mainframe, slowly draining CP at fixed rate
Security   -  Perimeter defenses (outside/near base)
   -  Outer defenses (near entrance, within outer ring of base)
   -  Inner defenses (within base)
   -  sentry guns, defense mobs, alert systems, locked doors,    

      -  preds: gkinmaaru?

2.  CP Implementation - CP for leeching mainframe, CP cost for repairing
   -  1 CP / minute for leeching, takes away from leeched clan, gives to 

            leechee's clan


3.  Resource system so CP can be drained from base

4.  Clan Raiding:  a formula must be made to determine who can access a clan and balance 

out members vs. raiders

5.  New script variable: clanplayers(), new script field: CP

   Originally a planet colonized by the Weyland Yutani corporation, the

aliens coined "xenomorphs".  They overran the colony, then drove themselves
underground.  The marines have established a small base on the planet, in
charge of the compound is Sgt.  Diles. The Atmospheric Processor that was
the epicenter of the original colony is still in tact today, but is heavily
infested with xenomorph.

`cPlanet Name`n: Earth
`cRecommended for`n: Levels 1-60
`cSpace Coordinates`n: 02-16-07
 
`cPlanet's Description`n:
Home to nearly eleven billion humans, Earth is one of the most industrialized
planets in the known universe. Home to Weyland-Yutani, New Eden Medical
Technologies, and other corporations of enormous wealth and power, the planet
is also home to rampant corruption and constant strife. Attempts to
peacefully govern the populace have failed, leading to more forceful measures
- armed guards, tear gas, and barricades are commonplace. Rival warlords,
overly competitive corporations, and gangs fight it out on the streets.
Bystanders are often caught in the crossfire. Rioting and looting is
widespread, largely unchecked by the overworked soldiers and policemen trying
to keep the peace and prevent the already bad situation from getting worse.
An Alien presence - a series of hives burrowed scant miles away from large
cities - is already on Earth. Even Predators have chosen this planet as a
hunting ground. It is only a brief matter of time until Earth collapses - but
there is one hope. The Colonial Marine Corp maintains many of its largest
bases on Earth, and much of their resources are spent dealing with the
problems that convulse the big cities. One of the biggest CMC bases is Camp
Pendleton, located in southwestern California close to San Diego and only 
hours away from Los Angelas. Due to the proximity of the base to those two
cities, a heavy Marine presence is maintained in both metropolises.

   Desolate winds howl endlessly in the frigid arctic landscape of Tierra.
Despite the planet's unattractive climate, Humans have came to the world to
study an excavated meeting hall, discovered deep underground. A small USCMC
base also occupies a gully in the wasteland.

`cRecommended for`n: Levels 61-70

`cPlanet's Description`n:
The vibrant planet Nahele is home to ancient forests teeming with life. A 
dense jungle canopy covers nearly the entire planet, providing hunting packs
of Yautja ample cover in which to stalk their prey. Weyland-Yutani has 
taken an interest in the planet as well - the Corporation's research
facility occupies an isolated section of the planet's jungle, well-hidden 
from aerial view. The USCMC maintains a small force on the planet partly 
because of the increase in Xenomorph activity around the hives located deep
within the heart of the jungle.

`cRecommended for`n: Levels 1-20, 41-50

`cPlanet's Description`n:
Surrounded by a thick atmosphere of methane gas, Yaut is the home of the
Predator species.  Thick jungles carpet the surface of the planet, teeming
with natural life.  Yautja hunters do not congregate in enormous cities -
instead, they live in small camps, where they are divided by rank and skill.
For the females, who are not hunters, it is a different story.  Enormous
cities house thousands of non-hunters - females, children, castrated failures
in the Yautjan race, and some Yautja who have grown too old for the hunt -
as well as heavy industry and craftsmen who produces the equipment those on
the hunt will need.  Dense jungles surround the camps and cities, although
the forests are occasionally distrupted by plains, beaches, or even deserts.

`cPlanet's Description`n:
An arid landscape, hostile and dry, sweeps across the dry world of Rhikora.
USCMC forces have been deployed hastily to defend against the Xenomorphs, 
who aim to overwhelm the humans and add to their already thriving hives.
Scattered CMC outposts and bases dot the sandy wasteland, strategically
located as to keep a vigilant eye on the numerous hives that inhabit the
region. Such reconnaissance proves only partially effective, as the hives are
connected through a series of underground tunnels. Remnants of the war-torn 
landscape litter the roads connecting the major industrial and military
installations, proof that the war will not be easily won for either side.

team
`cTeam`n
`C----`n

Team has three subfunctions: add, reset, and set.

Team add is for adding a player to a team.
>> team <color> add <playername>; ex. team pink add knight would add Knight to the pink team.

Team reset is for removing a certain team's members.
>> team <color> reset; ex. team pink reset would remove all players from the pink team.

Team set is used currently only for setting team recalls.
>> team <color> set loadroom <room vnum>; ex. team pink set loadroom 1239 would set the loadroom to Raid's office.

Team remove is used to remove a player from a team.
>> team <color> remove <playername>

As well, there are two other team related commands: reward and transfer.

You can reward a team by typing in: reward team <color> <amount>.
You can transfer an entire team by typing in: transfer team <color>.

`cClan Base Standards`n
`C-------------------`n

`c-bases start at 20 customized rooms, placed in any desired fashion, with restrictions of course
-bases must include room for: 4 generators, 1 recall, 1 deploy station, and 1 heal room.
-there are to be no gravity or tunnel rooms, as well as !snipe rooms, et al
-damage or heal scripts cannot be stacked in a single room
-generator rooms CANNOT be intentionally cheapened by having immediate one-way entrances into the room, damage scripts, etc
-generator rooms and all rooms WITHIN A ONE ROOM RADIUS cannot be made to the clan's advantage
-bases are allowed 2 closeable, non-lockable doors, defaulted to open (can't lead to gen rooms)
-every room within the base MUST be accessible to everyone.
-a single one-way exit is allowed, however, it cannot have a snipe range of more than 2 rooms, and cannot lead into a gen room
-bases are stationary - they cannot be moved by players

-upgrades will be listed later once bases are implemented and the CP system tweaked.`n

`cDEPLOYABLE DEPLOYABLES`n
`GUsage`n : enter <name of planet/zone>

  Deployables are transportation devices that directly transports a player to a specific zone. The deployables for aliens and marines are found 1 down from their respective race recall points. As for predators, they get a teleporter to Interstellar Space
(02-01-00) which is 1 east from their race recall.

  To use the deployables, the syntax is : enter <name of planet/zone>. For example, if a marine wished to go to the planet Blior, he would type 'enter blior' (without the quotes, of course). Then the player waits until the deployable departs from station
 into the relevant zone. The whole process is automated, and all the player has to do is to wait (patiently).

EGG EGGS 3665
`GUsage`n : `cinstall egg`n

The ability to use eggs is another advantage in choosing the alien race.
These eggs make use of the 'traps' skill, and thus, the higher the skill,
the faster it is to successfully 'install' an egg.  Eggs can be found at 
the Queen's Chamber located south of the alien recall point.

Once these eggs are successfull installed, they will 'hatch' and unleash a
facehugger whenever a non-alien player enters the room.  The facehugger will
latch on to the non-alien player (its host) and impregnate its host.  Shortly
after that, the host will die, spawning a chestburster.  If the chestburster
is not killed, it will have the chance to mature into either an alien drone, 
a warrior, or an alien queen.  If it does mature into an alien queen, then it 
will have the ability to produce eggs, which can be used to create a whole 
new colony.

Egging system revised dramatically.  New features include:
   `y* `nMP reward to player hiver for creating an egg hive based on maximum 
     population of matured aliens in particular hive, at every +5 interval
     of maximum aliens matured.
   `y* `nTo get a MP reward for hive expansion, you must first create YOUR OWN
     egg laying queen and expand HER hive using HER EGGS!  NOT THE LV QUEEN!
   `y* `nPK for egging re-enabled.
   `y* `nAlien players can initiate combat while carrying eggs.
   `y* `nBasic AI of spawned aliens increased dramatically.  Aliens will now work
     to help each other and combat invaders with greater efficiency by utilizing
     player skills.  They will also begin expanding their own hives by egging
     and coccooning potential victims.

`cBITE`n
`GUsage`n : bite

  The 'bite' command is an alien combat skill, that can only be used upon wearing the '`bglistening inner jaw`n', and can only be used in combat. The bite skill starts out weak and becomes stronger, faster and more accurate with use. In addition, damage 
nd accuracy are modified even further by player str and unarmed combat skills. Also, players may sometime successfully perform a `B*HEADBITE*`n which will damage the enemy as well as healing the player.

CLANBASE BASE
Every clan will be given a clan ship containing:
 - 30 rooms
 - 1 Recall/Peaceful room
 - 1 Clan Terminal and usenet terminal
 - 1 mailman at recall
 - 1 Mob Driver - drives in a random direction every 30 seconds
 - Radar Script at Cockpit for finding other clan ships
 - 1 Flag room for Clan CTF and a flag

Base layout must be designed in a coherent fashion, meaning rooms
going in one direction must return to the same room in the reverse
direction. No modifications to room flags, ie. gravity rooms, dts,
etc, or door flags, ie hidden exits, doors, etc.

HELP CLANUPGRADES - for info on upgrades to the base
Clan Guard names must be thematic to the AvP World, as do base themes.

GENERATOR GENERATORS SUBGENERATOR MAINGENERATOR
The clan generator system works as follows:

   1. Main generator - powers the subgenerators/subnodes in your base.
   2. Subgenerators - provide defense to the main generator.

A main generator can't be destroyed until its subgenerators have been 
destroyed.  5 CP will be rewarded for the destruction of a subgenerator, 
20 CP rewarded for the destruction of a main generator.  Upon destroying 
a clan's main generator, the generators of that clan will be protected 
from further destruction for 30 minutes.

Note that there are certain instances where players can't participate 
in raiding:
   
   1. Players of a clan whose own main generator is destroyed or protected.
   2. Each clan must have at least TWO members logged on.
   3. If a player isn't even in a clan!

Remember that the Clan Points (CP) gained from raiding can be used to buy 
further base upgrades, auxillary equipment, and CMEQ!

PROGRESSREPORTS

Beginning `cJanuary 1st, 2004`n, all staff will be required to submit weekly 
progress reports to the current `cStaff Admin`n.  Progress reports should 
consist of several lines describing the amount of work done in that particular 
week - ie; building done, missions ran, security breaches caught, etc.

Current Staff Admin: `cEnigma`n

Progress reports should be sent in by mudmail every Friday.  Negligence in 
sending in progress reports (two weeks without any form of report) will result 
in `Rimmediate`n termination of a position.  Salary, which will be determined 
by the progress report, will be allocated by the current Staff Admin once

roomstandrads
This is the building standards for rooms that all zones created will have to meet in 
order to pass.  Mobs and Objects have their own help files.

1) Please try to have around three to four lines in a room description.
2) Please do not put the following in a room description: you, your, you're, mobs or 
objects that can be destroyed or taken out of the room, and events that could not be going
on.
3) On Death Traps, no more than four per zone, more on approval.  The title has to be all
caps.  This is the only room description that breaks the rule about no mobs or objects and
even events described.  
4) Colors in the title of a room should be allowed if tasteful and limited in use. 
No Alternating colors.
5) Please try to show the players what they see, don't tell them.  Think about it like your
writing a story.
     Bad Example:  There is a chest in the corner of the room.
     Good Example: A chest sits in the corner of the room covered in dust.

If you need help with an idea, room, or something, feel free to contact me and I will be
more than willing to offer some assistance.

CLASSES
WE ARE BEGINNING TO PHASE CLASSES OUT OF THE GAME.

Step One - Classless Support MEQ - `GDONE`n
Step Two - Classless Skills      - `GDONE`n

All races use classes.  A player chooses a class by wearing its MEQ: its
armor and weapon.  Support MEQ (eyes, wrists, fingers, neck, waist, about)
are classless.  See `chelp support`n for more information.  Core MEQ (hands,
arm, legs, feet, head) are also classless.

Skill MEQ, the items that give racial skills, are classless as well.  See
`chelp alien_skills, help marine_skills`n and `chelp pred_skills`n

Each race has a CORE class.  A core class is the standard class for the 
race and is geared to be the most common.  The core class has a good 
balance between weapon damage, speed, and armor absorb.  For Marines this is
Rifleman, for Aliens it is Drone, and for Predators it is Hunter.

MARINES
   - Rifleman      (Weapons, Armor, Support)
   - Sniper        (Weapons, Armor, Support)
   - Heavy Support (Support)
ALIENS
   - Drone         (Weapons, Armor, Support)
   - Sentry        (Weapons, Armor, Support)
   - Warrior       (Support)
PREDATORS
   - Hunter        (Weapons, Armor, Support)
   - Spearslayer   (Support)

`YTier 1: Weakblood

`GQuick Attack`y: With this skill, Predators can quickly jab forward with a

    Predator must be locked in combat with its target before it can thrust
    forward with its weapon.
Syntax: `Gthrust

`YTier 3: Hulij-Bpe Yeyinde

`GAwu'asa`y: Reserved for only proven warriors, Awu'asa battle armor consists of
    a wire mesh and ceramic plates designed to bestow upon the user
    additional protection. Allows use of `bcomplex awu'asa hunting armor,
    reinforced with ceramic plates`y.
Passive Ability.

`GSmart Disc`y: Named for its advanced navigation system, a smart disc, when
    thrown, unerringly sails towards the target. It is guided by the hunter's
    targeting systems located in its hunting mask. The serrated edges of the
    disc have been laser-sharpened and are designed to penetrate the toughest
    armor and carapaces. It is not uncommon for targets to be torn in half by
    a disc throw. The disc requires a powercell to use, and drains the cell's
    energy by 4% per throw.

`YTier 1: Proletarian

`GReinforced Carapace`y: Allows use of `ba dense exoskeletal carapace, splattered
   with gore`y.
Passive Ability.

`GAcid Expulsion Membrane`y: Using specialized acid glands, a Sentry can expel a
   thick spray of acidic blood. This caustic shower injures all Marines and
   Predators without protective gear and can continue to burn a victim if
   left untreated. Synthetics are also not exempt from acidspray's effects.
   Aliens, however, are not affected by their own acid blood.
Syntax: `Gacidspray

`GHeavy Weapon Proficiency`y: Allows use of a set of `bovergrown talons formed from
   heavily calcified bone`y.
Passive Ability.

`YTier 2: Guardian

`GNeurotoxic Tailwhip`y: Using specialized neurotoxin sacs, the Alien can coat
   the bladed tip of its tail with a deadly poison. When it enters the
   bloodstream of a Human or Predator, it can cause problems with muscular
   coordination. When affected, a player uses more MV to move than he would
   normally.  Synthetics, being artificial beings, are immune to the
   neurotoxin. This tailwhip does not trap or injure the player directly, but
   if used correctly the poison can be just as debilitating as the Drone's
   tailwhip.
Syntax: `Gtailwhip <`Gtarget>

`GWall Hiving`y: A cunning Sentry can set up walls of hiving that prevent anyone
   nearby from shooting out of the room. However, they can still fire their
   weapons in the room where the hiving is, and they can still use melee
   weapons with no penalty.
Syntax: `Gsecrete `y<`Gresin type`y>
Syntax: `Ghive

`YTier 3: Hive Warden

`GImproved Acid Expulsion Membrane`y: Using specialized acid glands, a Sentry can
   expel a viscous spray of acidic blood. The acid severely burns any Marines
   and Predators caught within the blast radius. Even protective gear will
   not fully protect the plyer - it will only halve the damage received.
   Aliens are not affected by their own blood.
Syntax: `Gacidburst

`GSticky Hiving`y: By using specially secreted resins, a Sentry can lay a trap
   for its enemies. Unwitting enemies who blunder into the network of sticky
   hiving are more easily caught by the Xenomorph waiting in ambush.
Syntax: `Gsecrete `y<`Gresin type`y>
Syntax: `Ghive

HEAVYSUPPORT
`cClass: `GHeavy Support (Marine)`n

   Marines who choose the Heavy Support class are those who prefer its high
damage absorbtion, while dealing with the lower capabilities of its 
weapons.  Heavy Support marines work best in groups, due to their uncanny 
ability to take punishment.  If an enemy attacks a Heavy Support marine, 
that enemy cannot switch its target to another marine.  Also, the Heavy 
Support marine, when grouped, will take upon himself all the ranged attacks 
directed at the members of his group.  The Heavy Support marine, while 
heavily armored, is typically equipped with weaker weapons.

SKULL DESKULL SKULLS DESKULLING
`GUsage`n: `cdeskull`n <corpse> <#>

     Examples:

     `wdeskull corpse (deskulls first 'corpse' in the room)`n
`w     deskull corpse 5 (deskulls 5th 'corpse' in the room)`n
`w     deskull franklin (deskulls first corpse of franklin in the room)`n
`w     deskull franklin 2 (deskulls second corpse of franklin in the room)`n

Skulls are acquired from the corpses of a predator has killed.  Predators
cannot `cdeskull`n the corpse of a player they themselves did not kill.

To `cdeskull`n the corpse of a player, a Predator must wear a deskulling kit
and a properly charged regenerative power cell.  Each particular deskulling
kit has a deskulling delay time and a charge drain.  If the player's power
cell does not have the proper charge to power the kit, the player will not
be able to `cdeskull`n the corpse.  Additionally, if the player is attacked or
interrupted while deskulling a corpse, the skull will be ruined and the corpse
made useless.


There are six separate skull values:
`w----------------------------------------------------`n
1. tarei'hsan (mob skull, worth 0.10 `cskull point`n)
2. small  (lvl  1-30, worth 1 `cskull point`n)
3. medium (lvl 31-60, worth 2 `cskull points`n)
4. large  (lvl 61-80, worth 3 `cskull points`n)
5. huge   (lvl 81-100, worth 4 `cskull points`n)
6. gargantuan (lvl 101+/immortal, worth 5 `cskull points`n)
`w-----------------------------------------------------`n

After a particular number of skulls have been collected, they can be traded
at the `bHMEQ`n (`bHunt MEQ`n) equipment shop for trophy skull receipts, which can
then be traded for `bHMEQ`n.  If for whatever reason one collects more than one
receipt, use `cjoin`n to combine them.

`GUsage`n: `ctrade`n <skull name>

TRAITOR

The `cTRAITOR`n flag appears on a player who has killed a member of his own 
race.  The `cTRAITOR`n flag appears on the `cWHO`n list and will turn the
traitor's name to the color red, thus appearing as an enemy to all players.
A player with a `cTRAITOR`n flag will not be able to gain `cMPs`n from mobs
or players until he is killed, thus removing the flag.

WATCH
`GUsage`n: `cwatch`n <direction>

Use the `cwatch`n command to detect specific players and mobs moving
toward you and away from you.  Note that `cwatch`n will only work while
you remain in the room where you first typed the command.  If you move,
you will not be watching until you type the command again.  

Examples:
  > `wwatch west`n
`w    Nearby west you see a xenomorph brimming with rage move towards you.`n
`w    A ways west you see a horrid alien xenomorph move away from you.`n

Distance of target is determined by the number of rooms, indicated by notices 
such as "`wLittle ways`n", "`wNearby`n", and etc.

RETREAT
`GUsage`n: `cretreat`n <direction>

This command is used in groups by the group leader alone.  When using 
`cretreat`n, all group members present in the same room as the leader 
will flee upon a sucessful retreat attempt.  Retreat requires a direction,
so the group leader must specify one.  `cPerception`n and `cKnowledge`n
increase the successfulness of retreat.

Examples:

    >`w retreat w`n

Use `cignore`n so as to no longer hear anything from a certain player.  This
is useful for filtering out players who you may find abusive or annoying.  By
typing `cignore`n alone, you will see the players you are currently ignoring.
Use `cunignore`n to remove a player from your list.

MEDIC
`cClass: `GMedic (Marine)`n

   The medic class is unique in that the marines who choose it usually orient
their careers in combat to the service of other marines.  The medic engages
in combat passively by concentrating more on healing marines than by adding
firepower to their ranks.  The medic sacrifices efficiency in both weapons 
and armor to allow room for battlefield surgical devices.  The medic 
specializes in providing fast, effective medical support in the heat of 
battle.

Some special medic commands:
`cgroupaid`n heals all marines grouped with the medic.
`cstopaid/haltaid/endaid`n aborts healing.
`cheal`n will simply heal the medic alone.

`cMedic Marine MEQ: `yeast, up, north, down from marine recall.

ASSOCIATE
`YW`yeyland-`YY`yutani`n `cAssociate (Marine)`n`n

   The Company Associates are marines who have elected to pursue a more 
secretive and elite occupation, becoming more than just a piece of property
purchased from the USCMC under Company contract.  The Associates were 
created to combat the rogue xenoborg, a project begun by the Company that 
went horribly wrong, resulting in a new caste of xenomorphs equipped with 
full mechanical enhancements down to even the genetic level.  The Associate's
function is to recover, or if not possible, eradicate, the xenoborg while 
raising the least amount of suspicion among USCMC forces.  The Associate 
thus disguises himself as a mere businessman.  Under his sleek suit and 
suave accessories, the Associate conceals a vast array of combat tools 
and equipment necessary for tracking the xenoborg.  The Associate's 
armaments are superior to the highest level of USCMC technology, making an
otherwise innocent looking character extremely skilled and lethal.

XENOBORG
`YW`yeyland-`YY`yutani`n `cXenoborg (Alien)`n`n

   The Xenoborg experiment was a Company project begun without USCMC 
knowledge.  Weyland-Yutani spawned a few dozen xenomorphs and placed each 
into a coma where the Company completely edited their genetic strains, 
muscles, bones, and exoskeleton.  The result was a creature the Company 
named a  Xenoborg. This creature comes equipped with improved reasoning and 
sensory  faculties, more speed, strength, agility, coordination, and a full 
set of titanium armor grafted to its skin to provide a mechanical 
exoskeleton.  Many of the Xenoborg's nerves were lined with circuits and 
wires to relay information from the processor unit installed in the cranium 
to various parts of the body, providing advanced combat information, sensory 
readouts, radio transmitters for both communication among other Xenoborg and 
espionage on enemy channels, and a more evolved and efficient killing 
machine.  Of course, the Xenoborg project grew out of Company control, and
now an entire caste of Xenoborg roam the universe, seeking out home hives to 
support and help spread, further raising complete havok much beyond the 
abilities of the USCMC to quell.

MERCENARY
`YW`yeyland-`YY`yutani`n `cMercenary (Predator)`n

   The Yautja Mercenaries are an elite and rare class amid the Predator
social system.  Hunters who have tired of the usual hard and soft meat, 
these predators are Yautja who seek to hunt the new Xenoborg menance 
providing the deadliest challenge yet.  Having made light agreements with
Weyland-Yutani, the Mercenaries have agreed to allow the Company to modify
some of their ancient but advanced equipment with improvements necessary 
for hunting down the Xenoborg.  Of course, both sides have ulterior 
motives.  While the Company seeks only to use the Mercenaries to lead their
Associates to the Xenoborg, the Mercenaries have taken advantage of Company
knowledge and equipment to better defeat their newly born challenge worthy
to satisfy even the most expert of hunters.  This new caste in the Yautja
society strives unceasingly to achieve victory in the Hunt, while also
pursuing their traditional game among xenomorphs and humans.  Using the 
mechanized equipment and improved tracking and sensory devices provided by 
the Company, the Mercenaries are the latest level of victory for all Young
Bloods to dream of one day reaching.

PUNSISHMENT DENY MUZZLE FREEZE RIOT ACT RIOT_ACT RIOT-ACT
Punishments are given to players by the staff for breaking any number of rules
listed under `chelp policy`n.  Keeping in mind the spirit of the law more so 
than the letter, players can expect punishment for disturbing the peace of the
AvP community.  Punishments are carried out by the will of the witnessed or
offended staff member.  Punishments are also common for disrespecting the 
staff in either their authority or wishes; the staff is here to serve the

TIPS

`nWYMEQ, like MEQ, is divided into three categories: armor, affect, and about. 
Armor are pieces like body, head, etc that give armor absorb.  Affect are 
pieces like fingers, wrist, etc that do not give armor, but stats and skills.
About is the piece worn in the about slot that usually gives invisibility,
vacuum-safety, flight, and skills.  It is recommended to purchase affect
pieces first on account of their large skill/stat bonuses.

Affect pieces add much more stats/skills than any MEQ affect pieces.
Armor gives the armor ratings of lvl 91 MEQ if it was offered.
About pieces add stats/skills, unlike normal MEQ which only gives skills.

Abilities such as invisibility, vacuum-safety, flight, infravision, light
etc are found on the same WYMEQ slots as is on MEQ.  For example, just as
all marine about pieces give vacuum-safety and flight, so too does the 
Associate about piece.  For each class, some WYMEQ items may actually give 
new abilities not normally found on class MEQ.  Note that these bonuses
might be available on any of the three item types: armor, affect, or about.

Predators should pay close attention to the Mercenary equipment, noting that
the shiftsuit might be more of an advantage to lvl 41 players.

NOTE - Warriors and Snipers cannot wear WYMEQ body pieces, nor can 
Spearslayers wear the body piece or shiftsuit.  Please see a staff member
for a refund.  Currently, no other refunds are offered, so purchase wisely.

SPEARSLAYER
`CClass: `GSpearslayer (Predator)`n

   The Spearslayer class is a vanguard-type class of Predator.  They employ
light armor, close combat spears, throwing weapons, and stealth.  Typically
the Spearslayer is the Yautja who deals great melee damage while taking 
longer to swing such large and heavy weapons.  The Spearslayer also prefers
to attack his target head on, and thus uses minimal invisibility from 
Yautja shiftsuits. More skilled Spearslayers also prefer throwing spears and
javelins to attack their targets at range.  The most skilled of Spearslayers
can even learn how to use the extremely lethal smart disc.

A mishap with the egg storage capsule on board the Yautja hunting vessel

Hive can be used to create natural secreted resin structures in the room
that provide specialized affects.  To see a list of the types of resin this
gland can create, type 'secrete'.  You will be given a description of what
each resin type can do upon changing the type.  When you have selected a 
resin type, begin to install it by typing 'hive'.  Be careful - each resin 
type consumes a certain amount of resin and takes a certain amount of time 
to install. 

You can see what type of resin you are secreting by typing score. You can
also see how much resin you have by typing score.

pounce
`yAvailable Skill:`n `GPOUNCE`n

`GUsage`n: `cpounce victim`n (before/during combat)

Pounce utilizes the 'Unarmed Combat' skill to attempt to ambush before or
attack a victim during combat.  A successful pounce will stun your victim 
momentarily, rendering them immobile.  As pounce is an ambush themed skill,
you will receive a to-hit and damage bonus from pouncing on prey while 
hidden.  Pouncing during combat is done at your own peril, and receives a
large accuracy penalty.  A victim's 'Dodge' and 'Notice' skills serve as
a defense.

TAILWHIP
`yAvailable Skill:`n `GTAILWHIP`n

`GUsage`n: `ctailwhip`n (during combat)
Requires `G19`n MV

Tailwhip utilizes the 'Natural Abilities' skill to make a tail slash at 
a victim during combat.  A successful strike will temporarily trap your 
prey in combat with you, preventing them from fleeing and dealing a 
slight amount of damage.  A critical strike from tailwhip will also cause
prey to bleed uncontrollably for a short period of time, causing them to 
continue losing hitpoints while preventing them from healing.  An alien's 
prey uses 'Dodge' skill to avoid being whipped.

DAMPER
`yAvailable Skill`n: `GDAMPER (Hide)

`GUsage: `chide`n

   Though the Spearslayer lacks the sophistication of advanced Hunter 
shiftsuits, he is capable of hiding from his prey to better prepare for his
lethal attacks.  The dampening field wires into every regenerative powercell
and allows the Spearslayer to hide almost instantly while his fellow Hunters 
take quite some time to find an ample hiding place.  As is invisbility, the
stealth skills increases the Spearslayer's hiding effectiveness.

Damper MEQ is gained at `GLEVEL 31`n for Spearslayers.

ACIDBURST
`YAvailable Skill: `GACIDBURST`n

`GUsage`n: `cacidburst`n

Acidburst is a combat skill for aliens of the Sentry ability tree. Acidspray 
allows a Sentry to spray acid throughout the room, causing the acid to burn
marines and predators.  The accuracy of the spray is based upon the
'Natural Abilities' skill.  Prey use their 'Dodge' skill to avoid acidspray.

ZMUD
zMUD is a superior MUD client specifically because of the zMUD editor.  The
editor is a text editor which can send text directly to the command
line for quick insertion; particularly useful for building and scripting.
To access the editor, hold CTRL+SHIFT and hit ENTER.  This brings up the
editor window.  To send text back to the open zMUD window, hit the same
keys while in the editor window or go to File -> SEND.  Note that the editor
keeps track of characters which is useful since AvP is designed to have 78 
characters per line.

The most important function of both zMUD and its editor is its color syntax
options.  Properly set up, one can copy/paste text while retaining all
colors.  To do so, follow these instructions:

View Menu -> Preferences -> Color -> Color Syntax
In the 1st column, from top to bottom, enter: k b g c r m y w
In the 2nd column, enter: K B G C R M Y W
In the 3rd column, same as first - NOTE CASE SENSITIVITY IN ALL COLUMNS

Check the "Syntax Enabled" Box as checked and on

Foreground Color: ``F                 Background Color: ``^B
Syntax for Both: ``F``^B               Syntax for Resetting: ``n

In the zMUD editor window itself, goto Options menu and check all ON
EXCEPT for Parse, Prefix, Prefix Toolbar, Raw Mode, and Check Syntax

Lastly, under editor Options -> Preferences, set delay to 2 or below.

Now, enjoy your copy/pasting abilities and ease of editing room descriptions
and scripts using the zMUD editor.  For example, write your room description
using the editor, open redit, type /c and then SEND the text you write in 
the editor.

KNOWLEDGE KNOCHANGE KNOWCHANGE
`cChanges to Knowledge and Skill Point System`n

   To combat a certain popular trend, which decreased the value of
authentic gameplay, changes have been made to the Knowledge and Skill Point 
(SP) system.  Previously, characters gained Skill Points per level dependent
on the amount of Knowledge stat they had trained.  At certain "tiers" of this
stat, a character would gain an additional SP per level.  The minimum amount
of SP gain per level was `c11`n SP with 70 Knowledge.

   Each character shall receive a fixed amount of `c12`n SP perlevel-up.
Knowledge will no longer affect the amount of SP gained.  For example, a
Knowledge of 78 will no longer give the +1 SP per level-up.  Knowledge
will now be used soley for the Knowledge skills listed on `cprac`n.

   Many characters will have a negative SP value upon login.  `cUnprac`n STATS
FIRST.  It is FREE to UNPRAC a stat while having NEGATIVE SP.  So feel free
to untrain any and all STATS.  However, once the SP level reaches 0, it will
once again cost `c30`n MP to untrain a stat.  The cost for untraining SKILLS
is still waived.  

   Because of this, it now costs 3 SP to practice the Healing skill.

Using this skill, an alien will scale the walls of a room, hiding the alien,
and allowing it to move from room to room while maintaing its hidden state.
Note that this only works indoors.  Use wallclimb down to stop climbing and
resume normal movement.

Wallclimb works the same way as does hide.  It takes some time to activate,
and using commands such as say will end the hidden state.  Moving again will
re-enable hide automatically.

LEAP
`yAvailable Skill: `GLEAP`n

`GUsage`n: `cleap`n <direction> [range] 

`ba long pair of lean and muscular biomorphic legs`n

Leap allows the alien to jump into the air, landing in another room.  An
alien can leap up to four rooms away from its current room.  Leap is 
particularly useful for fleeing from combat.  After fleeing, the alien can
quickly escape the site of the fight, even passing out of range of most
marine rifles.  Leap is also helpful for avoiding rooms that may have mines,
traps, or some type of room specific hostility that is triggered upon 
entering a room.

Leap costs a small amount of movement points.  Leap will also not work in
avoid death traps.

Leap without a range automatically leaps two rooms.

Leap requires 28 Natural Abilities skill.

    when zero seconds are left on the clock. Nuclear failsafe mines are
    typically used as a 'Plan B' during hive assaults. If the combat team 
    fails to accomplish its mission, then a nuclear failsafe mine is
    installed and set to detonate. The hive is wiped off the map - no
    evidence remains to indicate that anything lived within several miles of
    the blast site. There is one drawback, however: due to the mine's high
    cost, the CMC does not keep a very large stockpile of them. Raze and
    blaze do not destroy nuclear failsafe mines.

CIRCLE CRIPPLE
`yAvailable Skill: `GCIRCLE`n

`GUsage`n: `ccircle`n

When using circle, a predator sneaks behind its prey and attempts to either
impale or bash it in the back.  Circle has three functions.  At low charge,
Circle deals a small amount of damage to prey.  A tier three hunter's circle
will 'cripple' a predator's prey, which will give them minor movement lag,
thus allowing the predator to  either swoop in for a kill, or run from 
a dangerous situation. 

Circle is also useful in killing an incapacitated player instantly, as it is
a free combat round.

Uses the skills `gdodge`n and `gmelee`n.

PLANETS PLANET

   A 'planet' is a place in the game where there are many (over five) zones
put together to create a large place for one to play in.  Each zone is
connected to other zones, usually by either a land route through the zone or
via an 'airway'accessable only by vehicles or personnel with EQ equipped
with the fly affect.  You can drive/spacewalk to the planet's object in
space and enter it from there.  However, you can also enter the teleporter
(which is located in your homeworld) to access a planet.  If you enter it
from space, you will land somewhere in the center of the planet.  If you
enter the teleporter, you will be sent to your off-world entry zone.  Once
at that zone, you may type `cbindpoint set`n to set your bindpoint to the 
off-world entry room.  If you die, you will come back to that room.  You can
also recall to that room by typing `crecall bind`n.

SMEQ
SMEQ is short for Skill Mission Equipment, which is `bMEQ`n that gives a 
player a specific, scripted skill.  These items are worn like `bMEQ`n and
are level specific.  They also require a certain value of a skill to use.
See `chelp alien_skills`n, `cmarine_skills`n, and `cpred_skills`n. 

SMEQusually costs a bit more `cMPs`n. SMEQ also do not offer much +skill/stat
bonuses, as is the sacrifice for acquiring a unique skill.

Marine SMEQ is typically referred to as `cGadgets`n, in that whereas an
Alien wearing `GPounce`n SMEQ instrinsically gains that skill via evolution,
a Marine cannot wear a piece of equipment and suddenly learn that skill
through evolution.  Therefore, Marines typically make use of gadgets, or
devices that perform a specific task.

TRAPS
Traps are unique devices that Predators use as aids in the hunting of their
prey.  Predator Elders are constantly crafting new and innovative traps that
coincide with the simplicity of Predator hunt weaponry.

Equipment:

Material costs for traps depend on your ability level in traps.
(Note: under `cabilities`n not skills in `cpractice`n)

The chance of a prey triggering your trap depends on your `yTraps`n skill in
`cpractice`n and the victim's `ynotice`n and `ydodge`n skill.

ACCURACY
`yAvailable Skill`n: `GACCURACY`n

`GAccuracy`n is a passive skill available to snipers only.  As Snipers gain
more experience in sharpshooting, they become more precise in their targeting
and thus are able to hit their targets in areas which inflict more damage.

A Sniper's `Gaccuracy`n increases randomly upon each successful shot.  As
more and more `Gaccuracy`n points accumulate, more damage is added to a
Sniper's shot.

To check your current level of accuracy, type `cscore`n.

REFUND TRADE
`GUsage`n:

`ctrade`n  <skull>
`ctrade`n  <WYMEQ item in inventory> <WYMEQ number from list>
`crefund`n <WYMEQ/TP item>

The `ctrade`n command is used both to trade in skulls for skull points at the
HMEQ shop (see help `Gdeskull`n), and is also used to trade one WYMEQ item 
for another at any WYMEQ vendor at the Weyland-Yutani Installation
(6-6-6).  Trading WYMEQ pieces have no penalty.

When using `crefund`n, or exchanging an item for its TP value, a 10% penalty
will be applied to its initial cost, thus one will not redeem full TP value.
Note that this only occurs with WYMEQ.  All other TP items such as dolls and
coupons can be refunded for their full TP value.

TRACKER DEBUG
`GUsage`n:`c tracker`n or`c debug`n

Yautjan Tracker: a tracking dart - Up, from recall
Marine Tracker: a tracking device attachment - East, Up, South, from recall  
 
Look at each tracker for instructions on how to use them.  Predators must
throw their tracking darts, marines must load their tracker as an 
attachment to an upgradable weapon.

Use the `ctrack`n command to track a victim after hitting them with the

INFILTRATE
`y`GInfiltrate`y allows a Marine to move while in cover.  Because it costs

OFFENSIVE-POSTURE DEFENSIVE-POSTURE POSTURES
`yAvailable Skill: `GOFFENSIVE`n and `GDEFENSIVE POSTURES`n

`GUsage`n: `coffend`n or `cdefend`n 

Experienced Hunters know that each Hunt requires different tactics, and
often times calls upon the use of different combat styles.  A Hunter may 
swing into a more defensive posture when outnumbered or protecting another
pack member.  A Hunter may also find an offensive posture better when hunting
numerous, weaker prey, or when hidden under the invisibility of a shiftsuit.

Typing `coffend`n or `cdefend`n enables these postures.  One can switch
from offense while in defense, or vice versa.  To go back to default, type
the same posture name again.

`cOffend: `nIncreases strength and coordination, decreases dodge and agility. 

`cDefend:`n Increases agility, dodge, and notice, decreases strength and
        coordination

MARINESKILLS MARINE_SKILLS
Below is a list of what skills provide a bonus or defense against the various abilities,
MEQ weapons, or items that Marine players can learn how to use. To Hit,
Damage, and Evasion are self-explanatory. Special affects describe special
qualities that the skill could give to the actor or the victim. Common
examples of those affects include being stunned, trapped, or poisoned. Some
things require two or more skills. Those multiple skills are averaged
together to form your evasion, damage, or hit roll. In addition, skills with
a piece of equipment in parenthesis indicate that you must be wearing or
wielding a piece of equipment that fits the criteria before you can use that
skill. Note that not all requirements are listed - many are quite obvious.
If an ability or skill is not on this list, then there is no skill that
affects it.

LADDER
The AVP Ladder system is a method for players to actively participate in a
system of organized structured PK.  The system rewards players for both winning
and participating in matches and fights. If you as a player are interested
in participating in a form of actively ranked PK, read on!


Basic Principles:
-You receive 1 point for a loss and 3 points for a win
-You lose 1 point for declining a match
-You may challenge ANYONE above your level
-You may only challenge 30 levels below your level
-Rank is determined by total points


Combat System:
-Will take place in enclosed arenas with a spawn point which your recall/respawn
will be set at.  First to 3 kills wins the "match." You will begin in this
enclosed arena at your start points and continue to fight in the arena,
once you die you respawn at your start point and go back at it.  The first to
acquire 3 kills wins.  Does not have to be consecutive. End result can be
3-2, 3-1, or 3-0.

Regarding level disparity and race-specific skills and items:

-It is in the nature of AVP to have 3 distinct races. Predators, Aliens, and 
Humans/Synths. Each race has thier own specific racial-specific skills and
equipment beneficial to those who of that race. All race-specific items, equipment,
and skills WILL be allowed. For lack of a better description, anything goes.
-Level damage has been effectively removed from the arena areas.
-Higher levels will still have a huge advantage due to thier access to better 
equipment, skill points, and stats points. This is to reward those players who
have put a signiifcant amount of time into thier characters while at the same time
not penalizing the casual player.  As stated in the previous room, higher
levels can only challenge 30 levels below, while lower levels can challenge any level
above.

-Each player will have a terminal posting which will include but
not be limited to the following:

 -Name
 -Race
 -Level
 -Total Wins
 -Total Losses
 -Total Matches played
 -Total Points

*** There will be also an updated terminal where players can check thier current
overall ranking. ********

Important Points:

-Each "ladder" will have a season, which will be a preset period of time.
-The winners of each season (top places, number dependant on entries) will have
thier name etched in a room for future generations to wonder at thier skill.
-Basically, the ladder gives you "bragging rights."
-Please be aware of the policy of AVP, any after-match harassment is NOT permitted.
will be ruled on by the Staff member running the match. 
-When you see another ladder player online, contact them and ask for a match, and
then attempt to find an online immortal who can run the match.

****************************************************************

Please Email Vader if you wish to enter the Ladder Season.  You may enter at
any time during the season.  Please see the Ladder Terminal for player stats,
updated ladder rankings, and general announcements regarding the Ladder.

#103
RUNLADDER
`w To run the AVP Ladder please do the following:
Once two players contact you to fight, check the Ladder Terminal to make sure
the players are ranked. Please refer to "help ladder" prior to running any
matches and familiarize yourself with the rules.  Provided conditions are met,
set the contestants team to solo, and loadrooms to (9361/9362) OR
(9302/9321) OR (9319/9335).  Then they begin once your force them to recall to
thier respective start points.  Nonstop fight with the first to 3 kills winning.
Make sure they get thier ammo before it starts. No loading once it begins.
Once a winner has been determined, please send an email to Vader saying who fought
who, and who won.  Vader will update the rankings on a daily basis.

clandesign basedesign
`n
Each clan base will be allowed 30 rooms.  Out of that 30, 4 must be 
set aside during design and construction for clan generators.  A set 
of simple rules must be followed when designing generator rooms in 
the base layout:

   1. Generators can't be in safe rooms (duh).
   2. The direct entrance/exit to a generator room can't be interfered
      with by gravity rooms, no-snipe exits, safe rooms, 1-way exits,
      tunnel rooms, or other cheapness of the like.
   3. Players must not be FORCED to go through a safe room to get to
      any generator room.
   4. Generator rooms will be made no-install.  This will be done by
      staff.
   5. Generator rooms can't have guard mobs or automated defenses 
      loaded into them.

With exception to these rules, clan bases may be designed as clan 
leaders and designated clan builders generally see fit.  Remember that 
other clans will attempt to raid your generators, so creating a strategic 
base design is ideal.

Clan builders must also provide staff members with a series of descriptions 
and locations for the objects that will facilitate their base functions.  
This includes descriptions/locations for:

   1. The main generator and subgenerators,
   2. A warning station (warning script),
   3. A healing station (heal script),
   4. A clan transporter (transports to multiple locations),
   5. An automated defense (attacks raiding clans).

For each object, clan builders must provide which room they want it to load 
in.  The clan's automated defense must also be supplied with a series of 
descriptions that will determine the messages used by the defense upon 
attacking, as well as a damage type for the defense to deal.  All other 
objects are set with default values.

PRIZES
With WYMEQ no longer in game to be purchased, token points have lost a great
deal of their value.  Token points are now only used to buy restrings, dolls,
the MP calculator, ammo, or saved for token prize sets, all of which are
still available at the Weyland-Yutani Installation at 6-6-6.  1 TP still
equals 25 MPs as well.

In lieu of this, we have created 'prize boxes.'  These boxes will be rewarded
in a fashion similiar to token packages, in that winners receive more than
losers, one box per kill in FFA, etc.  To redeem a reward from `Ka m`Ry`Ws`Rti`Wc`Ra`Kl`n
`cp`Br`ci`Bz`ce `Yb`yo`Yx`n, use `copen box`n. to redeem a reward.  Each box has a chance of being
anything from MPs to a very rare token set doll.  Boxes are NO-RENT, meaning
they will delete upon log off!

`cPrize Box Content Chances`n:
60% - MP Reward
20% - TP Reward
19% - Random Item Reward
1%  - Token Set Doll Reward 

`cPrize Box MP Rewards`n:
Lvl     MPs
1-10,   50-75
11-20,  75-100
21-30,  100-125

71-80,  220-230
81-90,  230-240

`RA Koosh`n - throw a 'koosh' ball at any player in the game!

`cToken Set Doll Rewards`n:
Token Sets prizes are usually rewarded by collecting specific tokens in 
collector's boxes as found at the Weyland-Yutani Installation.  Two most
popular token sets, the Dolls, can be pulled from a prize box.

`rA Small Stuffed `nA`Gl`Wi`Ge`nn `KQ`wueen `KD`woll`n

scmud starcraft
We are sad to see StarCraft MUD close.  In cooperation with Seishin, we are
offering an incentive for players of SCMud who have not played AvP, to give
us a try.

If you are new to AvP (your character was created after August 1st, you have
no alts, and you are less than level 15), and you had a level 21 or higher
alt on StarCraft MUD at the time of it's closure, then you are eligible for
a starting character incentive.

If you qualify contact an `Yadministator`n (type `cwizlist`n, the administrators
are at the top of the list).  You will need to provide the name of your
highest level alt from SCMud, the password for that alt, and the email
address that alt was registered under.

The only stipulation is that your character will be unable to give away
MEQ for 45 days.

Only one incentive is available per character; we track all players who have
received the reward, and delete them and all alts from our list.  Players
who try to abuse this incentive will be dealt with harshly.

Support MEQ are pieces of MEQ that use the `cwrist`n, `cfingers`n, `ceye,`n `cwaist`n,
`cneck`n.  The `cabout`n piece is also considered Support MEQ, but it only offers
skill bonuses, not stats.

Support MEQ is now completely classless.  The "classes" listed below are
used simply to identify one set of Support MEQ from another.  Players can
mix and match pieces from each set, or max out on all one set.  Each set 
focuses one what specific stat.  The "Core" (Hunter/Drone/Rifleman) sets
are a medium of the other two sets in terms of both stat and skill bonuses.

clanupdate clanchanges


10/06/05: CLAN ARENA is up and running for _testing_.  Check clan 
          transporters for the deployment location.  Thank
          MATTHIAS for his work on the arena.
10/07/05: Destroyable clan doors revised.  Clan doors now have 'HP',
          allowing raiders to pick up where they left off on door
          destruction if they are interrupted.  A door will operate
          properly when repaired if repairs are intitiated before the
          door is destroyed.  However, if repairs are initiated after
          destruction, the door will not operate properly until FULLY
          repaired to its maximum 'HP'.
10/07/05: Beacons can no longer be installed in transporter rooms.
10/07/05: Maximum clan size is being reduced to 15.  This is primarily
          a balance issue.  Leaders, adjust your ranks accordingly within 
          the next 48-72 hours.  Anyone who gets booted because of this,
          well, better luck next time.  Or make your own clan!
10/08/05: Multiple bugfixes over the last couple of days:
             1. Objects no longer auto-repair or auto-destroy on 
                interruption.  This has been fixed for a while now.  
                `RSTOP BUGGING ME ABOUT IT UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT
                STILL HAPPENING, WHICH A SIMPLE PURGE AND RELOAD OF THE
                OBJECT WILL FIX.`n
             2. The issue with beacons being destroyed when they are
                repaired and leaving the deployment location on transporters
                is fixed.  Hopefully most issues concerning beacons and
                transporters have been addressed.
             3. Aliens can no longer leap past clan doors.  I'm getting
                tired of having to hear about this kind of crap from NON-
                ALIEN clans because aliens want to abuse the hell out of
                and take advantage of everything and not say anything.
10/08/05: Clans now require at least ONE person on before you can destroy
          any of their minor equipment (doors, heals, transporters, warning,
          defenses).  TWO opposing members are still required before you can
          destroy generators.  This MAY be modified to require TWO opposing
          members at all time before you can destroy anything.

`RREMEMBER: MUDMAIL CLAN APPLICATIONS TO MATTHIAS!`n

11/29/05: Clans now are at a 10 member maximum. The survival of war/ally commands are pending.

SPRINT
`yAvailable Skill:`n `GSprint`n

`GUsage`n: `csprint`n <direction> <number>
       `csprint`n <direction> (no number automatically sprints 2 rooms)

`ba set of thin leg plates with synthetic fast-twitch muscle stimulators`n

One advantage of the synthetic, or 'articifical person', is its superior
speed over its human counterparts.  For USCMC personnel, this means moving
quicker in combat, and without strain to stamina.  

The `Gsprint`n skill allows a synthetic marine to quickly move up to 5 rooms
in one sweep, much like the xenomorph `Gleap`n skill.  Like leap, sprint
can move a synthetic pass death traps, or any other room specific hostility
such as mines, eggs, or traps.

This skill is a mechanical upgrade available to all synthetics, as it
requires some rewiring in the leg pieces.  The skill requires a great deal
of CPU energy to function, but allows a synthetic to raid or flee very
quickly.
  
Sprint is gained at `GLevel 31`n and requires 45 Engineering skill.

CULL
`YAvailable Skill:`n `GCULL`n

`GUsage`n: `ccull <dir>`n (during combat)
Requires `G19`n MV

Cull utilizes the 'Natural Abilities' skill to attempt to drag away the
lowest leveled group member of an opponent's group.  A successful cull
will drag away this person and start combat with him. A victim's 'Dodge'
skill serves as a defense.

RUSH
`yAvailable Skill`n: `GRUSH`n

`GUsage`n: `crush <victim`n>
`GPool`n: `c5 use`n / `c16-20 max`n

`ba pair of long and massively muscular barbed leg extensions`n

An alien uses the `cRush`n skill to lower it head to act as a battering ram.  A
successful rush on a a marine or predator will inflict him with 'daze,'
which disallows him from ranged combat for a specified amoun of time.  A
successful rush on a predator will cause him to drop from a posture.  Rush
uses the 'Natural Abilities skill, and a victim's 'Notice' skill serves as a
defense.

The skill pool system is now global, meaning that all skills use the same
pool. This also makes charging much easier. The skill pool can be charged
either during combat or by using the `ccharge`n command. The total skill
pool count increases by 1 point every 20 levels. For pool listing, type
`cskills`n while wearing any skill MEQ.

Rush MEQ requires 45 'Natural Abilities' skill.

lacerate
`yAvailable Skill: `GLACERATE`n

`GUsage: `clacerate <victim>`n

`ba lightweight, double-socketed ki'cti'pa mount`n
`ba wrist attachment mounted with a set of sharp ki'cti'pa`n
`ba heavily plated, double-socketed ki'cti'pa wrist mount`n
`ba lengthened ki'cti'pa wrist mount designed for lethal jehdin/jehdin `n`bcombat`n

A predator can extend his wristblades and lash out at his prey, inflicting
a wound that will 'bleed.'  Bleeding deals a small amount of damage over
time, and prevents a victim from healing.  

Lacerate uses the 'Melee' skill, and a victim's 'Dodge' skill
serves as a defense.


Lacerate is a freebie skill, meaning any predator with wristblades can use it.

`ba duraflex plated, combat-tested M4G-1c flightsuit`n
`ba custom designed, lightweight ghillie suit with a shrouded hood`n
`ba titanium armored external spacesuit for extra-terrestial affairs`n

Rally is a simple skill used to boost the morale of routed marines.  An
officer can encourage his men to continue fighting even when they are well
below their normal combat effectiveness.

Rally restores some movement points, and temporarily boosts coordination and
agility both for all friendly marines in a room, and all group members in the
same zone who are below 50% of their hitpoints.

Rally MEQ can be purchased at `GLevel 21`n.

ambush
`YAvailable Skill:`n `GAMBUSH`n

`GUsage`n: `cambush victim`n (victim optional)
`GUsage`n: `cambush stop`n

Ambush utilizes the 'Natural Abilities' skill to attempt to ambush a victim
before combat.  Once initiated, ambush is completely passive.  You may not
move while ambushing (wouldn't want to be seen, would you?).  If no target
is selected for the ambush, the first enemy to enter the room will be
attacked.  If a target is selected, all other enemies will be ignored.
A victim's 'Dodge' and 'Notice' skills serve as a defense.

Your average horde of mindless killing machines bent on total galactic 
genocide and then feasting upon the corpses of the enemy, except that 
we focus on PK. The `KI`Rn`Kv`Ra`rs`Kiv`re `K I`Rnt`re`Rrn`rec`Ki`ro`Rn`n are a conclave of xenomorphs 
that bear a deep, red color to their exoskeletons rather 
than the midnight black of many other xenomorphs. This is obviously from
a steady diet of gore and bloody remains, aswell as they're all caked with 
dry blood. Nothing but this odd coloration is given to 
the hive. Like most xenomorphs, the species of Invasive  Internecion
are bloodthirsty, and will kill just as readily as take hosts. They are known
to fight amongst themselves at times. 
The hard clay of the hive was impart, sculpted into a series of tunnels by
the xenomorphic acid-blood, due to its solidity making it hard to dig out.
Yeah, base theme is lame, but as for now its really all a hive is, a dug out 
web of tunnels where people die and it starts to smell even worse.
I wish to be clan leader because I'm capable, irresistably good-looking, 
and I have experience, and possibly skill at playing. I enjoy the aspect
of player killing and wish to spread this while making the challenge of the
game greater for other people, and thus much much more enjoyable, hopefully.

RAIDING
Every clan has a clan ship in space, which can be found with the aid
of a radar. Most clan objects are destroyable and once destroyed will
repop in one hour, unless their clan flag has been captured. To
capture a flag, you must be in a clan and your clan must have a flagroom.
Go to an enemy flag room and type `cCAPTURE`n to begin capturing their
flagroom. An enemy's flag may only be captured when their flag is in their
own room. If other enemy flags are in another enemy's flagroom and you
successfully capture it, you will free their flags instead of capturing it.
A clan without a flag will not have their objects or driver repop as an
incentive to regain their flag.

clanrumble
Clan Rumble Match -
In light of wiping clan CP (to be done at 5 PM on 12/13/05 and at 10 PM 12/13/05)
a Clan Rumble Match will begin after the first wipe. The goal is for each clan to gain as much CP
as possible. The clan with the most CP at 10 PM EST will gain 1/2 of their total CP or 1000 CP.
All other clans will gain 300 CP. The rumble match takes place INSIDE THE ARENA.

For Further questions, mudmail MATTHIAS. Thanks. 

(This is in reward for the clans who have remained active over the period of time where 
clan banks were inert.)

`cPlanet's Description`n:
   Lush forests cover the planet, uncontrolled by humanity.  The few humans,
who have been isolated on the planet after landing in Emergency Escape Vehicles
(EEV's), have learned to adapt to their surroundings.  Harnessing water as an
energy source, their hobbled-together camp quickly grew into a small city.  
But they were not alone - the Yautja have known of Varlier for some time.  
Numerous hunting clans enjoy stalking their prey within the Xenomorph hive,
which is nestled within a series of hills.

`YTier 1: Soldier

`GHeavy Armor`y: Allows use of a heavily plated set of `bM4 combat armor, custom
    fit with titanium covers`y.
Passive Ability.

`GPhysical Fitness`y: Constant training has paid off. You are considerably
    tougher than the average soldier. This first rank adds 15 to your total
    movement.
Passive Ability.

`GInfiltrate`y: Allows a Marine to move while in cover.  Because it costs
    movement points per use, it can sap MV very quickly, often leaving
    careless Marines drained of stamina. Obviously, you must be in cover to
    use this ability.
Syntax: `Ginfiltrate `y<`Gdirection`y>

`YTier 2: Veteran

`GClose-Quarters Pistol Maneuver`y: This highly risky maneuver involves a marine
    rolling onto the ground, pulling out his or her pistol, and firing a
    burst at an enemy's head. Although he or she has a chance for three
    headshots, the marine is vulnerable while lying prone.
Syntax: `GCQM `y<`Gtarget`y>
You must be locked in melee with your target before you can attempt to use
    this ability.

`GPack Rat`y: Allows one to carry 3 longarm guns (instead of 2). Also slightly
    boosts the amount of weight you can carry.
Passive Ability.

`GSOPS Unit: Location`y: You can use the SOPS unit to locate another player's
    position. Locate by itself will display the locations of your grouped
    teammates, while locate with an argument will attempt to find the
    location of a specific player.
Syntax: `Glocate `y<`Gtarget`y>
Syntax: `Glocate`y

`YTier 3: Special Forces

`GMotion Tracker`y: Allows use of a `bUSCMC special-issue motion tracker`y, which allows
    you to detect movement in any direction up to three rooms away.

`GAdvanced Physical Fitness`y: Constant training has paid off. Your incredible endurance
    and toughness adds 25 to your total movement. This stacks with the +15 MV
    gained from the first rank.
Passive Ability.

`GSOPS Unit: Supply Drop`y: Using the SOPS unit, a Marine can call in a supply drop or
    a combat buggy. Note that the CMC can only send a supply ship to the
    Marines once every 30 minutes.

`YTier 1: Marksman

`GSniper Rifle Proficiency`y: Allows use of a `bcustom M42A sniper rifle with
    extended barrel and adjustable scope`y.
Passive Ability.

`GFlamethrower Proficiency`y: Allows use of an `bM240-B incinerator unit, enhanced
    with a carbon injection stream and napthal filter`y.
Passive Ability.

`YTier 2: Sharpshooter

`GSmartgun Proficiency`y: Allows use of an `bM56 hydraulic-servo mounted smartgun`y.
Passive Ability.

`GRaze`y: Raze is a flamethrower ability that allows the weapon's operator to
    light a room on fire for a period of several seconds. Items in the room
    are burnt and anyone caught within the flames as they burn suffer fire
    damage. The special fuel that Raze uses is designed to 'stick' to
    surfaces it touches.
Syntax: `Graze `y<`Gdirection`y>

`YTier 3: Expert Gunner


`GRocket Launcher Proficiency`y: Allows use of an `bM83A2 SADAR rocket launcher`y.
    It's worth noting that the SADAR works differently from any other weapon
    in your arsenal. Examine the weapon to see a description of how to
    operate it.
Passive Ability.

`GMinigun Proficiency`y: Allows use of a `b.50 caliber P-155 mini-gun with attached
    heat sink`y. It's worth noting that the Minigun works differently from any
    other weapon in your arsenal. Examine the weapon to see a description of
    how to operate it.
Passive Ability.

`GBlaze`y: Much more potent and deadly than its smaller brother Raze, Blaze is a
    flamethrower ability that allows the weapon's operator to light not only
    a nearby room on fire, but also the room adjacent to it. If a marine
    blazed north, for instance, the room immediately north and then the room
    two paces north will catch on fire for a period of several seconds. Items
    in the room are burnt and anyone caught within the burning flames suffer
    fire damage. The special fuel that Raze uses is designed to 'stick' to 
    surfaces it touches, incinerating anything caught in the flames.
Syntax: `Gblaze `y<`Gdirection`y>

Note: Blaze's length is automatically 2 rooms, if there are two rooms to
    blaze into. If not, then the length is one room.`n

`y    bomb to explode, catching anyone caught within the blast radius `n`yon fire.`n
`y    Installation costs 2 trap points.`n
`ySyntax: `Gtrap install firebomb`n

`GGas Trap`y: Although greatly underestimated by many warriors, the `n`ycunning`n
`y    hunter realizes the advantages that traps can provide during an `n`yambush.`n
`y    A gas trap, effective against Humans and rival Predators, will`n
`y    temporarily blind anyone who comes in contact with the poisonous `n`yvapors.`n
`y    Installation costs 2 trap points. The Alien's ability to detect `n`ypheromes`n
`y    will also be adversely affected.`n
`ySyntax: `Gtrap install gas`n

`YTier 3: Master Trapper`n

`GGrappling Hook`y: The grappling hook allows a Predator to snag a `n`ytarget from`n
`y    afar and pull it into the same room as the warrior. The `n`ygrappling hook`n
`y    requires a powercell in order to be used.`n
`ySyntax: `Ggrapple `y<`Gtarget`y>`n

`GBalance (Lag/MV) Trap`y: This trap, when sprung, causes a victim to `n`ytrip and`n
`y    fall. The victim is knocked to the ground and suffers movement `n`ypoint`n
`y    damage. This trap costs 3 trap points to install.`n
`ySyntax: `Gtrap install balance`n

`GTrap Positioning`y: Normally a trapper would only be able to plant two `n`ytraps`n
`y    in a room - but with this ability, he or she is able to plant a `n`ymaximum`n
`y    of three traps in a room.`n

`YTier 1: Tyro

`GDefensive Posture`y: By use of this ability, a warrior can assume a stance that
    allows him to dodge blows and react faster in combat. True hunters would
    rarely, if ever, use this position in combat, but less confident warriors
    may make use of it.
Syntax: `Gdefend

`GOffensive Posture`y: The Hiju position, commonly accepted by warriors as the
    proper position to disembowel a target, helps a hunter in landing a
    killing blow. When maintaining an offensive posture, the hunter gains a
    bonus to coordination and strength.  If he moves, then he resumes a
    normal stance.
Syntax: `Goffend

`GRage Armor`y: Allows use of `bceremoniously etched Hiju battle armor`y.
Passive Skill.

`YTier 2: Pugilist

`GRegular Hand to Hand Attacks`y: Rage, a form of combat with an emphasis on
    strength and speed, utilizes many unarmed combat moves. This skill grants
    the Hunter proficiency in using his body as a deadly weapon that is more
    than capable of overpowering even heavier and stronger targets.
`ySyntax: `Gcfist `y<`Gtarget`y>
`ySyntax: `Gestrike `y<`Gtarget`y>

`GThrowing Spears`y: Allows the use of `ba heavy throwing javelin, tipped with a 
    barbed point`y.
Passive Skill.

`YTier 3: Jehdin/Jehdin Champion

`GRage Combos`y: By stringing together certain hand-to-hand moves, a warrior can
    learn how to unleash devastating combos. Combos cannot be taught -
    instead, they must be learned through practice and experimentation.
    Combos happen automatically, after you use the correct sequence of skills.

  `YAbility Points`y allow a player to `Rlearn`y their skills. All members of a race 
  receive `gFreebie`y abilities, such as Kick, Bite, or Lacerate. This means that 
  `n`yevery Marine can kick, every Alien can bite, and every Predator can lacerate 
  an opponent. These`n `yfreebie abilities are free, and do not cost Ability Points 
  to learn.`n

  `yEvery race has three skill trees, and each skill tree has three tiers. With one 
  Ability Point, a player can boost one of his skill trees up one tier. `n`yEarning 
  the tier to a skill tree entitles the player to ALL the skills listed under that 
  tier. Players ca`n`yn spend their Ability Points in any way they choose.`n

`y  Players must type '`clearn `y<`Gability tier`y>' to use their Ability Points.`n

`yExamples: `n

   `yA marine can invest 3 Ability Points into rifleman, raising his 
   rifleman tier from 0 to 3.`n

   `yA marine can also invest 2 ability points into rifleman, and one into 
   combat and tactics, thereby boosting his rifleman tier from 0 to 2 and 
   his `n`ysniper tier from 0 to 1.`n

   `yA marine can invest an ability point into every skill tree, resulting in 
   him earning one tier from each skill tree.`n

   `yRemember: When you earn a skill tree's tier, you get all of the abilities 
   of that tier.`n

  `yPlayers will have 3 Ability Points given to them at creation. They can 
  unpractice their skill trees if they are in recall. Unpracticing skill trees 
  is `n`yfree and does not alter your ability points in any way.`n

  `yPlease see `GHelp Abilities`y and `GHelp Ability_Tree`y, as well as the 
  more specific helpfiles pertaining to each skill tree and skill tier.`n

pred_skills predator_skills predskills predatorskills
`yBelow is a list of what skills provide a bonus or defense against the various
abilities, MEQ weapons, or items that Predator players can learn how to use.
To Hit, Damage, and Evasion are self-explanatory. Special affects describe
special qualities that the skill could give to the actor or the victim.
Common examples of those affects include being stunned, trapped, or poisoned.
Some things require two or more skills. Those multiple skills are averaged
together to form your evasion, damage, or hit roll. In addition, skills with
a piece of equipment in parenthesis indicate that you must be wearing or
wielding a piece of equipment that fits the criteria before you can use that
skill. Note that not all requirements are listed - many are quite obvious. If
an ability or skill is not on this list, then there is no skill that affects
it.

TIERS TIER

Skills and stats in AvP work on a "Tier" system. 
Tiers are the levels that your skills and statistics will have the
greatest affect on your character.
If a skill or stat falls in between the tier numbers, it will perform
at the nearest tier, rounded down.
For example if you have dodge anywhere from 56-65, it will not make a 
difference in effect until you get the skill up to the next tier,
which is 66.

The tiers are:
1 - 3 - 6 - 10 - 15 - 21 - 28 - 36 - 45 - 55 - 66 - 78 - 91 - 105 -
120 - 136 - 153 - 171 - 190 - 210

STAFFGUIDE INTERNGUIDE STAFFGUIDELINES
+-------------------`RSTAFF HANDBOOK OF GUIDLINES`n-------------------+

+- RULES`n
    +- Use common sense, if you're an interns your main concern should be
       finishing the task laid out for you during you probationary period 
       by your head of department or acting Department Head. Don't even
       bother to try and do anything else unless you have made significant
       progress. This Includes:

           +- Do not run missions unless supervised by a Sr. Staff or
              a Staff member who has been authorized to supervise you.

           +- Do not give out titles or colored titles. 

           +- Do no award players using any award/reward command unless
              it is in the mission reward standards. (help rewardstandards)

           +- Do not make a doll, you will be notified when you are allowed
              to do this after your probationary period - If you are stay on
              as a staffer.
            

    +- Do not multiplay unless authorized to by Sr. Staff or above. 
       (102 + may multiplay between a TEST character and their staff
       account ONLY for testing their work - this test character should
       be clearly marked as a test character and deleted after.)
    
    +- Do not question the afore mentioned rule, you will be notified
       when you can multiplay between your mortal and staff character.
    
    +- Do NOT beg for a promotion; this only shows that you care more about
       your personal advancement and less about your care for the game.
       You will be approached about a promotion. 
    
    +- Do not put into play any content that has not been authorized by a
       Sr. Staff or above. Special circumstances may apply if you are a
       
    +- Do not release game sensetive or character sensetive 
       (Ip adress/Alternative accounts/stats) to mortals.
    
    +- Do not interfere with gameplay in anyway. Interns shouldn't
       even be dealing with mortals unless they are running a mission
       or are preforming a PR based duty that involves assisting mortals.
   
    +- Yes, slaying and killing is interfering with gameplay.
    
    +- Do not modify gameplay, stats, or content in anyway to assist
       your mortal or other mortal characters.
     
    +- Follow Policy as if you were a mortal. Show the same amount of respect
       to a player as they show you, on your staff account. Do not bring
       fights from your mortal onto your staffer, this is generally grounds
       for harsh punishment.
    
    +- You are representing the MUD, aswell as the AvP Team. If you want to 
       be part of the AvP Team, you must act like it. What you do reflects
       onto the rest of the staff. You are a role model, act like it.

    +- Do not make mobs that do not follow current mob standards. Ask
       the Head Builder or a Terraformer about where to locate these.
   
    +- Do not make a mirad of useless or over complicated missions. 
       If you're not going to finish your intern work, then don't even
       bother finishing reading the file.
    
    +- Do not make overpowered EQ. 
    
    +- Do not make over-generous mobs, missions, etc.

    +- Do not make zones or mobs that have nothing to do with the AvP World.
       a zone full of pokemon would be deemed inappropriate and your attitude
       would be deemed as one that isnt trying to get work done, but just 
       mess around. 
    
    +- These are flexible rules, you won't be deleted or punished short of 
       reprimand in any of the afore-mentioned cases.
   
    `^m+- ALL CONTENT - PERIOD - MUST BE AUTHORIZED BY A SR. STAFF OR ABOVE.`n
    
+- Punishment:

    +- In the case of blatant cheating, immediate termination and deletion
       of any, or all, accounts, there will be no questions asked, and you
       will be hardpressed to earn another staffing position.

    +- Minor policy infringments will be met with a reprimand, meeting 
       between Sr. Staff.
    
    +- In any case the punishment is at the discretion of the punishing staff
       member. If you break a minor rule and or accidently do something, don't
       get upset, mistakes happen, we won't crucify you.

SCOPE SCOPING
`yAvailable Skill: `GSCOPING`n

`GUsage`n:`C aim `n<target> <head|body|arm|leg>

By looking through the scope of a sniper rifle an expert sniper is able to
pick out specific locations on a target. Targetting, and sucessfully shooting 
these specific locations allow the sniper to disable or damage the target in
certain ways that is normally impossible for combat. This skill requires
patience and luck. 

You must be `cprone`n to use this skill.

Head: Massive Damage
Body: Bleeding, minor, body armor is damaged and thus less protective.
Arm: Disable combat and the use of weapons.
Leg: Disable movement

PRONE 
`yAvailable Skill: `GSCOPING`n

`GUsage`n:`C prone`n
`GUsage`n: `Ccrawl`n<north east south west up down>
Requires `G10`n MV

By going prone a sniper can become harder to hit from a distance. While prone
it is easier to stabalize your body thus enabling you to use the sniper `cscope`n
to a greater advantage.

You can move while prone but you must `ccrawl`n, this is slower than normal
movement.

STALK
`yAvailable Skill: `GSTALK`n

`GUsage`n:`c stalk `n<target>

If you cannot be seen by the target, and the target is in the same zone as
you,  you can begin 'stalking' the target. While the target is being stalked
they will be unable to recall and will feel as if they're being watched and
followed.  You will know where the target is in relation to you, presuming 
they are within your line of sight.

`YAvailable Skill: `GSTALKER SENSES`n

SWARM SWARM_TACTICS
`yAvailable Skill: `GSWARM TACTICS`n

When aliens come together in groups, they
become a swarm. Sentries who have evolved into guardians can augment
the swarm's overall defenses and abilities as a ravenous unit. This passive
skill gives the swarm insight to the status of other members of the swarm.
For instance, if a member becomes separated and is pressed with combat, the
swarm will be able to sense the offensive or defensive pheremones released by
the embroiled member.

BITE ACIDIC_BITE
`yAvailable Skill: `GBite`n
`GUsage`n: `cbite`n <target>

You use your inner jaw to viciously bite an opponent. 
If the opponent is severly damaged enough you will instantly kill them.
This portion of bite is a freebie skill that all aliens have access to. 

Warrior aliens who have evolved to nightmaric proportions will bite more
lethally. Their successful bites deliver potent acid that prevents the wounds
from healing. Warrior aliens have a tendency to bite off a chunk of the
victim's flesh and devour it, causing a minor increase in health.

toxin neurotoxic_tailwhip mutation_tailwhip
`yAvailable Skill:`n `GTOXIN TAILWHIP`n

`GUsage`n: `ctoxin`n (neurotoxin/mutation)
`c       tailwhip`n (during combat)
Requires `G19`n MV

Tailwhip utilizes the 'Natural Abilities' skill to make a tail slash at 
a victim during combat.  A successful strike will temporarily trap your 
prey in combat with you, preventing them from fleeing and dealing a 
slight amount of damage.  A critical strike from tailwhip will also cause
prey to bleed uncontrollably for a short period of time, causing them to 
continue losing hitpoints while preventing them from healing.  An alien's 
prey uses 'Dodge' skill to avoid being whipped.

A `cneurotixic tailwhip`n will leave your opponent groggy, and cause him to
have problems moving around.  A `cmutating tailwhip`n will cause the victim's
corpse to mutate and eventually turn into an egg.

`GUsage`n: `cwail`n (during combat)

When an alien `cwails`n, he causes all enemies in the room, other than the
one he is fighting to panic, usually resulting in them fleeing.  The
horrifying noise of the wail usually frightens an enemy so much that he
cannot muster the strength to fire a shot for some time.
